## 2026-10-10 (after 12:09 KST; exact log capture time not given) — CAL NtSide0 SDevice actually advancing to 4.122 V (OBSERVED LOG, NOT FINISHED)

- Worker 이택규 supplied live command output from `tail -n 40 /user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL/n2_des.log`.
- Last **confirmed completed** step is `Computing BE-step from 0.824472 s to 0.824478 s`, `Finished, because |RHS| less than 1.0000E-03`. Newton iteration 2 RHS `7.30e-04`; per-step total wallclock 7.39 s. Terminal `anode voltage=4.122E+00`, `anode total current=4.344E-14` in raw output units. If the known 0–5V linear time ramp is unchanged, `0.824478*5≈4.12239 V`. Thus approximately 82.45% of **voltage sweep**, not runtime, complete.
- The **next BE attempt** `0.824478→0.824487 s` at `8.3662e-06 s` shows iterations 0–5; final printed iteration 5 RHS `1.10e-03` above `1e-03` threshold. Its acceptance, cutback, failure or subsequent progress cannot be determined because output excerpt ends mid-iteration.
- **Interpretation:** Real numerical progress verified at least to 4.122 V (stronger evidence than SWB Running). There is a possible Newton convergence slowdown at high bias, not yet confirmed stall/error. 100ns InGaN override **still NOT verified effective** from this excerpt; time-to-finish cannot be projected reliably.
- **Read-only next action:** retain running job and unchanged input; sample log later to check last accepted t/V and repeated 'Newton didn't converge'/step-retry messages; also inspect preprocessed/custom parameter usage only without edits. No source or simulator modification was made by AI.

## 2026-10-10 12:09 KST — CAL SDevice continues running in SWB (USER-REPORTED / LOG UNVERIFIED)

- Worker 이택규 reports that the previously launched `CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL` SDevice still appears **running** in SWB at ~12:09 KST on Oct 10, with no completion observed.
- Start time described as "어제 새벽 1~2시" (literally Oct 9 01:00–02:00), which would imply 34h09m–35h09m elapsed, but the same CAL project's SDE meshing was previously screenshot-confirmed completed **Oct 10 00:11:50 KST**. A **different interpretation of the date** (Oct 10 01:00–02:00) implies 10h09m–11h09m; therefore actual start date/time is **UNRESOLVED**, and must not be treated as known.
- **SWB running display is user-reported only**; there is no freshly supplied CAL `n2_des.log` or `n2_des.out`, no observed accepted BE steps/current voltage, no proof the 100ns material override was applied, and no reliable ETA. Do not call this a hang or success.
- Next **READ ONLY**: inspect `tail -n 40 /user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL/n2_des.log` and the SWB job/experiment identity and start timestamp; compare changing accepted-voltage/current and Newton retry patterns. Keep existing run and original completed 5V parent intact; no parameter/source edits while it is running.

## 2026-10-10 — CAL SDevice user says Run pressed (REPORTED / NOT YET VERIFIED)

- 이택규 reports SWB SDEVICE Run launched for separate `CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL` NtSide0; original parent 5V run ~2h56m36s, but new InGaN SRH Scharfetter tau_max=100ns trial may change convergence and time. No live solver log or job PID from this new run reviewed yet, so cannot assert active computation, actual 100ns applied or finish. Next: request new project's actual `n2_des.log` tail and SWB node running/failed status, then diagnose/monitor and extract 5V I(V), QW SRH/radiative/Auger. Scientifically CAL remains a parameter sensitivity trial, not physical final baseline.

## 2026-10-10 — CAL 1.2.0 InGaN 100ns .par edit observed on server; preprocess NOT done

- 이택규 live `tail` confirms `CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL/FASTC1_pp6_des.par` now includes material-specific InGaN Scharfetter `taumax=1e-7,1e-7 s` plus other vendor default fields. This resolves the prior missing-override file-edit gate only.
- Input provenance: SDE/SDevice remain cloned from successful NtSide0 5V parent (previous SHA256 match). The SDevice source explicitly points to custom `FASTC1_pp6_des.par`, not auto-generated `sdevice.par`. No cloned SDE mesh, SDevice preprocess, or CAL numerical run has been verified.
- NEXT: read-only verify parameter path in cloned SDevice source; SWB preprocess and inspect model parse/effective 100ns override; build separate true short Transient BE smoke before 5V candidate. Preserve original 5V parent.

## 2026-10-10 — CAL clone source parity confirmed (OBSERVED)

- User checked three SHA256 hashes in new CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL. Each exactly matches independently audited successful 5V_TEST parent: SDE, SDevice, custom .par.
- New project has not received 100ns InGaN SRH candidate yet, and has not been preprocessed/run.
- Next: transfer private ZIP from chat via SFTP and verify it on server; then safely install only new .par in clone, preprocess, short transient smoke.

## 2026-10-10 — CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL new SWB project visible (OBSERVED)

- 이택규 SWB screenshot shows project `CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL` exists under `/user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/`, SDE→SDEVICE topology and one `NtSide=0` experiment. Both tool result cells are `--`, so no successful preprocess, mesh or SDevice runs evidenced. Completed parent JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST remains listed.
- Next read-only verify new project's sde_dvs.cmd, sdevice_des.cmd and FASTC1_pp6_des.par exist; then apply private 100ns candidate files ONLY to the clone, inspect correct parameter path and conduct preprocess + truly short Transient smoke. No run started in this screenshot.

## 2026-10-10 — CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL input package prepared locally, not yet executed (PROPOSED / STATIC PASS)

- Worker 이택규 supplied live T-2022.03 MaterialDB/InGaN.par 855–925: explicit GaAs-origin warning, Scharfetter taumin=0/taumax=1e-9 both electrons/holes, Nref=1e16, gamma=1, Auger A=1e-30, Radiative C=2e-10. Consistent with private completed 5V TDR audit.
- AI locally created **private** downloadable `CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL_INPUT_CANDIDATE.zip` containing unchanged parent `sde_dvs.cmd`, only-comment-corrected parent `sdevice_des.cmd`, appended `Material="InGaN" { Scharfetter { taumin=0; taumax=1e-7 electron/hole; Nref=1e16; gamma=1; ... }}` custom `FASTC1_pp6_des.par` preserving lattice, thermionic, GaN Mg, and README. SDevice executable lines identical. ZIP verification PASS. Private candidate .par SHA256 adfe81ab03b8f0ca84b09b9a4373fdc8e71f7a5faa00ce01a7c0b82b7fb2f1ad. No new solver run or SWB preprocessing/clone yet.
- Material Scharfetter override syntax supported by Sentaurus training, but effectiveness with user's local T-2022.03 is UNTESTED. Do not write vendor MaterialDB or original parent; next recommended SWB `Project > Save As > Clean Project` into CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL, then copy candidate sources in cloned project only, preprocess, and create truly SHORT Transient-BE smoke by changing sweep Goal to <=0.3V in a second experimental copy; the distributed sdevice_des.cmd is a FULL 5V source, NOT a smoke.
- 100ns is literature-motivated sensitivity, not measured GaN/InGaN lifetime. Publication full/half, J normalization and injection gates remain open.

## 2026-10-10 — 5V parent code/HDF5 audit results (OBSERVED/DERIVED), CAL 1.2.0 NOT RUN

- Worker 이택규 uploaded 9-file private archive; independent source/log/PLT/HDF5 review documented in `CMP/reviews/BASELINE_1_2_0_CAL_AUDIT_20261010.md`. 5V Transient finished normally (~2h56m36s), mesh 65513 vertices. Actual Solve was single 0–5 V Increment1.2, Save only at 5V; contrary to source comments about staged 1.05 and intermediate saves.
- **Resolved computational Mg model check:** -DopingConcentration = MgActive*TrapOccupation_Mg per point across Clean/Dmg pGaN, max Mg occupancy ~3.1286% corresponding ~3.00033e17 effective acceptor. MgMinus raw-looking plot field should not be used alone to infer 100% ionization. This is numerical consistency, not physical calibration.
- **New decisive recombination finding:** all 8 Clean/Dmg InGaN QW regions of n2_des.tdr obey Rrad/(np)=2e-10, RAuger/[np(n+p)]=1e-30, RSRH(n+p)/(np)=1e9/s (effective tau=1ns). The uncalibrated recombination physics is ACTIVE in actual solved result, not just parsed; four-well radiation fraction 0.10947% modeled only.
- 5V anode I=1.44801646079583e-11 raw 2D current, provisional J≈7.24e-4 A/cm2 under A/um & 2um width (needs local manual validation); transient steady state/full-half not proven. CAL 1.2.0 still only PROPOSED, no source edit or simulation.
- NEXT: local InGaN.par exact Scharfetter/param override review -> distinct 1ns vs proposed literature 100ns sensitivity without other physics change -> short Transient smoke -> NtSide0/1e18 5V comparisons, same-current and mesh/Full gates. A/B production NO-GO.

## 2026-10-09 — CMP naming confirmed, next candidate CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL (DECISION / PROPOSED RUN)

- User confirmed naming standard `CMP_<TYPE>_<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>_<TAG>`, canonical policy `CMP/PROJECT_NAMING_CONVENTION.md`, replacing preliminary name `CMP_BASELINE_CAL_V1`. Version histories are independent per family; `CAL` denotes intended calibration scope, not completed validation.
- In live `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`, user `ls -lh` confirmed presence of 9 private source/input/mesh/log/TDR/PLT files needed to inspect the completed 5V NtSide0 run, but original contents were not uploaded to this chat. No new project or simulation launched.
- Next: private input archive → active physics/material/current review → separated parameter-only pilot → short Transient BE smoke → NtSide0/1e18 5 V comparison; keep Full/Half+mesh equivalence and scientific calibration gates before baseline freeze.

## 2026-10-09 — 이택규 CMP_BASELINE_CAL_V1 preparation chosen (PROPOSED; NOT RUN)

- Keep 12 MB pre5V tar.gz backup in place per user decision. Preserve completed JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST NtSide0 5V transient result and original full/fine reference.
- New private candidate proposed: CMP_BASELINE_CAL_V1, building from verified Half+Coarse 5V reference with 4 InGaN QWs, 5nm physical sidewall damage, protected Mg/EBL/nGaN doping, and known convergent Transient-BE. No SDE/SDevice edits or simulation launch yet.
- Critical gates: obtain exact private active SDE/SDevice/FASTC1 .par/pp-decks/mesh/log; verify applied InGaN SRH/Radiative/Auger and material mixing, provisional J/AreaFactor and injection before choosing evidence-backed parameter-only sensitivity updates; then NtSide0 pilot→5V, NtSide1e18 comparison. Full/Half/mesh convergence and matched-current quantities mandatory before final publication baseline/A/B production.
- Claude cannot be directly addressed in a separate chat through this session; questions recorded in CMP/.ai-sync/RELAY.md for later reader. Current team status remains A/B PRODUCTION NO-GO.

## 2026-10-08 — 주수빈 accelerated Half+coarse QS smoke deck prepared (PROPOSED)

- Half+coarse SDE mesh actually built successfully; 138,194 elements, 65,513 points.
- Current 0→0.3 V transient smoke is accepted but slow (~109.74s/step with ~90.20s linear solve).
- Private SWB SDevice alternative generated: `sdevice_des_JUSUBIN_HALF_COARSE_QS_SMOKE.cmd`, SHA256 `a7281c79e7e440c6192726f4ce6edefb58f8d76ed30ec921900fee5ff5a5ec01`.
- Steady QS anode 0→0.3 V; InitialStep=.03, MaxStep=.15, Increment=1.5, MinStep=1e-6, Decrement=2; original full device physics/traps and Math/ILS preserved.
- Static syntax/region checks PASS, actual QS preprocess/run NOT DONE. Original full FAST_C1 reference untouched.
- NEXT: user installs file in SWB after stopping only old Node2 smoke if desired; preprocess `pp2_des.cmd` and run QS 0.3V test.

## 2026-10-08 — cmp216 FAST_C1 test: apparent interruption, cause unresolved

- OBSERVED (user shell outputs): separate `cmp216@ssudisu2` run in `~/FAST_C1_ACCOUNT_TEST`. Last accepted Node6 0.9534 V; next BE-step logged header only. Log last modified Oct 7 17:47; PLT Oct 7 17:45; no `n*_des.tdr` found; no active `cmp216` SDevice process on checked host.
- `grep` search found license checkouts but no explicit fatal/killed/aborted/normal-completion marker.
- UNRESOLVED: why the run stopped producing output, including login/session termination or process failure. Cross-account performance effect beyond low bias unverified.
- NEXT: read-only process/session/job/launch history check; retain files and ongoing `semi437` references untouched.

## 2026-10-07 — Project A/B pre-run audit: Baseline parent OK; production A/B NO-GO until gates pass

- 작업자: 주수빈
- 상태: REVIEWED / PRE-RUN GATE
- FAST_C1/Common Baseline은 A/B parent로 유지 가능; physical baseline 재구축 필요 없음.
- same-current I-V + intermediate spatial TDR 기반은 유지되고 실제 FAST_C1 Node 6에서 intermediate TDR 생성 확인.
- broad multi-day A/B production은 아직 NO-GO.
- 필수 gate: active pp-deck audit, dataset/extraction test, J normalization, A Cedge geometry/mesh/physics/null control, B exact vertical span + AlBarrier geometry/mesh/null control, Save/Load smoke, representative A/B pilots.
- Project B가 QW edge를 AlGaN으로 치환하면 active QW volume이 달라질 수 있으므로 total recombination뿐 아니라 QW-volume normalization 및 injection/leakage metric을 함께 사용.
- 상세: `CMP/PROJECT_AB_PRE_RUN_AUDIT.md`.

## 2026-10-06 — D6 complete; Save-based C2 smoke next

- 기존 C1 `Plot(-Loadable)` intermediate는 restart state 정보가 없어 current Node 6 restart에 사용 불가.
- Option 3 폐기, Option 2만 유지.
- Node 6/12 reference run 계속.
- 다음: revised C2 smoke에서 `Save` checkpoint를 생성하고, 그 Save 파일에 대한 `Load` check 수행.
- 첫 common C2 정책: Iterations=15 유지, Increment=1.05 시험.

## 2026-10-06 — D3 IV extraction and D5 CPU headroom check

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: OBSERVED / VALIDATION

### D3 I(V) extraction
- copied live current files parsed successfully with proposed `iv_window.py`.
- Node 6: 3323 points, V range 0 -> 4.7128 V, I_max = 2.8954e-12 A/um (under standard 2D no-AreaFactor interpretation).
- Node 12: 1236 points, V range 0 -> 4.2474 V, I_max = 7.9816e-14 A/um.
- selected same-voltage Node12/Node6 total-current ratios:
  - 3.0 V: 0.9566
  - 3.5 V: 0.9562
  - 4.0 V: 0.9252
  - 4.1 V: 0.8150
  - 4.2 V: 0.5829
  - 4.23 V: 0.5276
  - 4.24 V: 0.5125
- provisional current-density conversion with 4 um mesa gives values only ~1.5e-6 to 3.8e-6 A/cm2 in the shared 3.0-4.24 V range; default target list 0.1-1000 A/cm2 is not reached.
- therefore Decision 0 (truncate production range based on already-reached J window) is NOT supported by current data and remains pending.
- explicit AreaFactor is absent in pp6/pp12 cmd/par. Older Sentaurus documentation states default 2D width 1 um / current unit A/um, but exact T-2022.03 manual confirmation is still pending before publication use of J.
- the extremely low extracted current density should be treated as a model/result sanity-check item, not automatically as a valid LED operating-current range.

### D4 current snapshot
- 21:52 KST:
  - Node 6 latest attempt t0=0.942564 -> ~4.71282 V.
  - Node 12 latest attempt t0=0.849478 -> ~4.24739 V.
- both runs remain live and progressing.
- fixed 1-2 h progress-rate measurement is not yet complete from this snapshot alone.

### D5 CPU resource
- nproc=128.
- load average ~7.46 / 7.70 / 7.81.
- active SDevice CPU: Node6 ~280%, Node12 ~268%.
- CPU headroom is ample for a short third smoke/load test.
- Sentaurus license headroom remains unverified.

- next: D6 scratch Load test using Node 6 4.7 V intermediate TDR without stopping Node 6/12; if license unavailable, the test must not disturb reference runs.

## 2026-10-06 — D2 exception check confirmed; D3 structural gate passed

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: OBSERVED / VALIDATION
- Node 12 accepted >8-iteration exceptions are real accepted transient steps, not parser artifacts:
  - idx 1103: V0=4.233805 V -> V1=4.233915 V, dt=2.1351e-5, 15 iterations, final RHS=9.98e-4, wallclock=121.55 s.
  - idx 1165: V0=4.237610 V -> V1=4.237710 V, dt=1.9766e-5, 13 iterations, final RHS=9.98e-4, wallclock=104.02 s.
- both barely satisfy RHSMin=1e-3, confirming that universal C2 caps 8/10 would create genuine false rejections.
- common C2 Iterations=15 decision is strengthened.

### D3 structural checks
- Node 6 current file: n6_des.plt, 1.4 MB, mtime 2026-10-06 21:45.
- Node 12 current file: n12_des.plt, 496 KB, mtime 2026-10-06 21:46.
- both preprocessed File blocks point Current to the corresponding .plt.
- both .plt datasets include time, anode OuterVoltage/InnerVoltage, eCurrent, hCurrent, TotalCurrent, Charge.
- no explicit AreaFactor string found in pp6_des.cmd/par or pp12_des.cmd/par.
- therefore .plt files are suitable for I(V) extraction.
- absolute current-density normalization remains provisional until exact T-2022.03 default 2D current/AreaFactor semantics are verified; older Sentaurus documentation indicates default 2D current units A/um when no AreaFactor is specified.
- next: run iv_window.py on copied live .plt files to obtain I(V) and provisional J(V), while keeping Decision 0 pending.

## 2026-10-06 — D2 complete: cap 8/10 not safe for common C2

- Node 6 accepted max Newton=4; cap 8 false_rej=0.
- Node 12 accepted max Newton=15; accepted 13-iteration and 15-iteration steps exist.
- Node 12 cap 8/10 each predict 2 false rejections; first divergence ~4.195 V.
- Decision: first common C2 keeps Iterations=15; test Increment=1.05 first.
- Original cap-8 C2 deck is provenance only and must not be executed as-is.
- Next: inspect Node 12 >8 accepted exceptions, then D3 current normalization/J-window.

## 2026-10-06 — D1 complete: high-bias failure is not a GMRES-maxit stall

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: OBSERVED / DIAGNOSIS
- Node 6 representative failed step (0.942217 -> 0.942229, dt=1.1842e-5):
  - nonlinear factor remains 1.00e+00.
  - |step| remains about 1.33e-2 to 1.34e-2 instead of collapsing toward zero.
  - #iterative is typically ~48-54, far below configured linear-solver maxit=200.
  - RHS drops rapidly to ~1.41e-3 by Newton iteration 2 and then remains essentially flat through iteration 15.
- half-step retry (dt=5.9211e-6):
  - #iterative remains similar (~50-52), yet RHS reaches 4.58e-4 at Newton iteration 2 and converges.
- therefore the observed failure is NOT explained by the inner GMRES reaching maxit, and the linear-solver iteration count itself does not distinguish failure from success.
- the logged error column alternates between values similar to those also seen on the successful retry, so its semantic meaning must not be over-interpreted without the T-2022.03 manual.
- working interpretation: a timestep-dependent nonlinear residual floor just above RHSMin is the immediate bottleneck; this supports testing safer high-bias timestep growth before changing the linear solver.
- implication for FAST_C2: keep linear solver unchanged for the first C2 candidate. Proceed to D2 accepted-iteration audit before approving Iterations=8.

## 2026-10-06 — Claude high-bias runtime analysis reviewed; FAST_C2 proposed

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: REVIEWED / PROPOSED / NOT EXECUTED
- Claude package `FAST_C2_strategy_for_GPT.zip` reviewed by ChatGPT.
- central diagnosis accepted as a working numerical model:
  - high-bias runtime is dominated by a local convergent-timestep ceiling (`dt*`) plus `Increment=1.2` growth -> expensive rejection -> ~0.5 cutback cycling.
  - Node 6 representative failure: dt=1.1842e-5, RHS ~1.41e-3 stagnates through Iteration 15; retry dt=5.9211e-6 converges in 2 iterations.
  - idealized cycle model reproduces current Node 6 speed (~2.24 mV/h model vs ~2.2 mV/h observed).
  - under the same idealized assumptions, Increment=1.05 + Iterations=8 gives ~5.24 mV/h; this is a model prediction, not measured C2 performance.
- FAST_C2 remains numerical-only PROPOSED:
  - staged global-time Transient
  - 4 V+ Increment 1.05
  - candidate Iterations 8 subject to D2 accepted-iteration audit
  - checkpoints at 4.0/4.4/4.6/4.8 V
  - RHSMin/physics/mesh/5 V endpoint unchanged
- important ChatGPT caveat:
  - changing iteration cap/timestep growth changes the transient step sequence; identical convergence criteria do not by themselves guarantee identical trap/transient state.
  - NtSide=1e18 C2 validation must include trap charge/occupancy, SRH, radiative/Auger and carrier distributions, not I-V alone.
  - Claude trap-emission estimate uses generic GaN assumptions and is not a confirmed active-deck timescale.
- current Node 6/12 runs MUST continue as reference evidence.
- syntax/manual gates remain unresolved: segmented InitialTime/FinalTime+Goal semantics, Save/Load syntax, and whether existing Plot(-Loadable) TDR can be loaded.
- Decision 0 is separate and pending team approval: whether production analysis endpoint may be defined by a validated current-density window instead of always requiring 5 V. Baseline 5 V endpoint is not changed.
- `iv_window.py` J values are provisional until AreaFactor/2D current normalization is verified.
- public files added:
  - `CMP/FAST_BASELINE_C2.md`
  - `CMP/tcad/tools/make_restart_deck.py`
  - `CMP/tcad/tools/iv_window.py`
- proprietary full C2 deck was NOT uploaded; recorded production deck SHA-256 = `b876f614424202e6deaf0655411d7bc15733095da297c1df9ca5ebaacbb578d1`.
- helper scripts passed Python syntax and synthetic-only tests; no live Sentaurus test yet.
- next: D1–D6 in order, then C2 smoke gate before any production C2 run.

## 2026-10-06 — Node 6/12 logs confirm forward progress with repeated timestep cutback, not a hard stall

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: OBSERVED / RUNTIME DIAGNOSIS
- user-provided logs show both SDevice runs are advancing in accepted pseudo-time.
- Node 6 (FAST_C1):
  - recent BE-step attempts progress through ~0.942147 -> 0.942238.
  - representative failed attempt: 0.942217 -> 0.942229, dt=1.1842e-05, reaches Iteration 15 with RHS ~1.41e-3 and is rejected.
  - automatic retry halves the step to 5.9211e-06 and converges in 2 iterations with RHS 4.58e-4.
  - subsequent accepted steps increase again (7.1054e-06, then 8.5265e-06).
  - mapped bias is ~4.711 V at pseudo-time ~0.9422 for the known 0->5 V ramp.
  - diagnosis: not hung; local nonlinear convergence causes periodic reject -> ~0.5 cutback -> quick recovery.
- Node 12 (FAST_C1_Copy):
  - recent BE-step attempts progress through ~0.848534 -> 0.848697.
  - repeated pattern visible: larger attempt rejected, then step approximately halved (e.g. 2.1922e-05 -> 1.0961e-05; 1.8941e-05 -> 9.4703e-06; 1.9638e-05 -> 9.8188e-06), followed by renewed growth.
  - accepted steps generally converge in 2 iterations around 18-19 s in the provided tail.
  - mapped bias is ~4.243 V around pseudo-time ~0.8486 for the known 0->5 V ramp.
  - current last shown attempt at dt=2.0360e-05 had RHS ~1.17e-3 by iteration 3, so its eventual accept/reject outcome is not yet shown.
- conclusion:
  - no evidence of syntax error or frozen solver in these logs.
  - dominant runtime cost is repeated high-bias step rejection/cutback, especially Node 6.
  - do not terminate current runs solely on suspicion of a stall.
- next:
  - keep current runs as reference evidence.
  - accelerated branch should target numerical continuation / sweep strategy and/or reduced mesh, while preserving physics.
  - any solver-policy change must be validated against these reference trajectories.

## 2026-10-06 — Node 6 and Node 12 SDevice processes confirmed alive at evening check

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: OBSERVED / RUNTIME
- user-provided process listing at ~2026-10-06 21:43 KST shows both baseline runs have live SDevice processes:
  - FAST_C1 Node 6: PID 69457, command `sdevice --max_threads 4 pp6_des.cmd`
  - FAST_C1_Copy Node 12: PID 93915, command `sdevice --max_threads 4 pp12_des.cmd`
- both processes showed active CPU usage in the provided `ps` output.
- a solver line `Computing BE-step from 0.845455 s to 0.845473 s (Stepsize: 1.7909e-05 s)` was also provided, but the originating project/node is not yet attributable from the pasted context alone.
- `ls n6_des.out` failed only because it was run from the home directory (`~`), not from the FAST_C1 project directory; this is not evidence that the log file is missing.
- next: inspect timestamp and tail of `n6_des.out` and `n12_des.out` from their respective project directories to determine whether accepted pseudo-time is still advancing or a convergence retry loop is occurring.

## 2026-10-06 — Runtime-first half + coarse-mesh candidate prioritized

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: DECISION / DEADLINE ACCELERATION
- 기존 FAST_C1 full Node 6/12는 reference로 유지.
- 새 accelerated branch는 half-domain + coarse remote/global bulk mesh를 동시에 적용하여 10/23 전 preliminary result 확보를 우선.
- active physics/critical mesh는 유지: MQW, EBL, GaN/InGaN and GaN/AlGaN interfaces, 5 nm sidewall damage.
- first gate before long solve: SDE mesh build only -> element/point count + visual mesh sanity.
- half-domain current normalization: full-device total current 비교 시 2×I_half 또는 current density 사용; IQE ratio 자체는 ×2 하지 않음.
- branch classification: preliminary/screening until full-reference equivalence/mesh-convergence is demonstrated.

## 2026-10-06 — Oct 23 abstract deadline: runtime-first triage

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: CRITICAL DEADLINE / DECISION
- 논문 초록 마감: 2026-10-23.
- primary blocker: FAST_C1 Node 6/12가 multi-day runtime을 요구하고 Node 6은 ~4.68 V 부근 high-bias timestep collapse가 관찰됨.
- current full-reference runs는 가능하면 유지하되, 이들의 완주를 기다리는 것을 critical path에서 제거.
- immediate parallel task: same physics/mesh의 numerical-only accelerated branch short benchmark.
- first methods to audit: Quasistationary DC sweep vs current Transient ramp, staged continuation, Save/Load/restart, bias segmentation, thread/output overhead.
- publication constraint: physics/trap/geometry를 runtime 때문에 완화하지 않으며 acceleration은 reference-equivalence validation을 통과해야 함.
- abstract strategy: 10/23 전 모든 sweep 완료가 아니라 defensible baseline + 최소 mechanism-relevant preliminary result를 확보.

## 2026-10-06 — Priority reset: finish and validate Common Baseline before Project A/B

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: DECISION / PRIORITY
- 사용자가 연구 우선순위를 Common Baseline 완성으로 재확정.
- 즉시 우선순위:
  1. FAST_C1 Node 6 (NtSide=0) 현재 run 유지 및 완주.
  2. 별도 프로젝트로 시작한 Node 12 (NtSide=1e18)의 실제 정상 실행 여부를 process/log로 확인.
  3. 두 run의 source/mesh/parameter/numerical provenance를 확인.
  4. 완주 후 I-V, convergence, key output sanity를 검증.
  5. 두 조건이 모두 통과한 뒤에만 FAST_C1 Common Baseline을 freeze.
- Project A/B 설계 및 sweep은 baseline freeze 이후로 보류.
- publication-grade 기준 유지: physics/trap/geometry/convergence criterion을 일정 때문에 임의 완화하지 않음.

## 2026-10-06 — Deadline-aware publication-grade simulation strategy

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: DECISION / RESEARCH STRATEGY
- 사용자 요구: 결과는 논문에 사용할 수 있을 정도로 수치적으로 타당해야 하지만, 전체 연구 일정도 맞춰야 함.
- 결정:
  1. publication-grade reference/final cases와 screening cases를 분리한다.
  2. Common Baseline 및 최종 대표 A/B case는 full validation(0–5 V, same physics, mesh/convergence checks)으로 유지한다.
  3. broad parameter exploration은 operating-current/bias window 중심의 reduced-window screening으로 수행한다.
  4. screening winner/representative/worst case만 full 0–5 V로 최종 검증한다.
  5. C1 Iterations=15은 numerical-only candidate로 유지; full-range equivalence validation 후에만 baseline freeze.
  6. RHSMin 완화 같은 convergence-criterion 변경은 publication baseline에 바로 적용하지 않는다. 별도 sensitivity/convergence study로 결과 불변성이 입증될 때만 고려한다.
  7. 우선순위 높은 시간 단축 수단: parallel independent runs, staged bias schedule, thread benchmark, checkpoint/restart, mesh coarsening only after mesh-convergence evidence.
- 논문 방어 원칙:
  - physics/geometry/trap model을 runtime 때문에 임의 완화하지 않는다.
  - numerical acceleration은 reference와 I–V/Vf/spatial metrics equivalence를 검증한다.
  - 최종 논문 figures/tables는 validated runs에서만 생성한다.
- 현재 실행:
  - FAST_C1 Node 6은 C1 full-reference evidence로 유지.
  - Node 12는 자원 확인 후 separate clean project에서 병렬 실행 고려.
  - A/B full brute-force sweep은 하지 않는다.

## 2026-10-06 — FAST_C1 Node 6 confirmed progressing after 41 h 05 min wall time

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: OBSERVED / RUNTIME
- direct process evidence at 2026-10-06 08:51 KST:
  - sdevice PID 69457
  - ELAPSED = 1-17:05:26 (~41 h 05 min wall time)
  - CPU = 280%, consistent with multithreaded activity
  - process state SNl
- n6_des.out modification time = 2026-10-06 08:51:49 KST, proving the log was actively updating.
- recent accepted pseudo-time advanced to at least ~0.936443; current attempted endpoint ~0.936458.
- mapped anode bias remains ~4.682 V.
- C1 cap is active: repeated '#iterations larger than 15.'
- recent successful attempts still converge in ~21 s with 2–3 Newton iterations, but occasional attempts sit just above RHSMin and run toward the 15-iteration cap.
- high-bias timestep remains ~7e-6 to 1.45e-5 pseudo-time, so the remaining ~0.318 V can still take a long time.
- conclusion: Node 6 is not hung; current blocker is high-bias timestep collapse, not process death.
- planning implication: two-node sequential completion can plausibly take multiple additional days; Node 12 runtime cannot be assumed equal without evidence and may be similar or worse.
- do not launch broad A/B full-sweep brute force from this runtime pattern.

## 2026-10-06 — FAST_C1 Node 6 confirmed alive at ~4.682 V; Iterations=15 active

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: OBSERVED / RUNTIME EVIDENCE
- process evidence:
  - gsub PID 69166
  - gjob PID 69396
  - sdevice PID 69457 at ~99% CPU
  - FAST_C1 project path confirmed
- `n6_des.out` timestamp observed: 2026-10-06 08:49 KST, size ~3.5 MB.
- latest accepted pseudo-time observed: approximately 0.936405.
- 0→5 V ramp mapping gives latest accepted anode target ≈ 4.682025 V; current attempted step to 0.936419 corresponds ≈ 4.682095 V.
- solver output directly shows anode voltage 4.682E+00 V on recent accepted steps.
- C1 cap is definitely active: repeated `#iterations larger than 15.` followed by timestep retry.
- recent accepted steps converge in 2–3 Newton iterations and ~21–22 s wallclock.
- current difficult attempt at 0.936405→0.936419 reached iteration 14 with RHS ~1.03e-3, just above RHSMin=1e-3; likely near rejection unless the next iteration converges.
- recent timestep scale is ~7.8e-6 to 1.6e-5 pseudo-time, showing severe high-bias timestep contraction.
- interpretation:
  - run is NOT hung at the captured time.
  - C1 successfully removes the old 50-iteration cap behavior, but the dominant remaining bottleneck is now very small high-bias timesteps and repeated 15-iteration rejections.
  - latest accepted bias exceeds the prior copied x8 audit endpoint (~4.643 V) by ~39 mV.
- remaining voltage from 4.682025 V to 5.0 V is ~0.317975 V.
- do not estimate finish time from full-run average; high-bias tail is strongly nonlinear.
- next: quantify recent progress rate over a longer fixed window (e.g. 30–60 min of log) and count accepted/rejected attempts to estimate remaining runtime more defensibly.

## 2026-10-06 — FAST_C1 Node 6 still unfinished after ~41 h 48 min

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: USER-REPORTED / RUNTIME BLOCKER
- FAST_C1 Node 6 recorded start: 2026-10-04 15:46 KST.
- Current checked time: 2026-10-06 09:34 KST.
- Elapsed since recorded start: approximately 41 h 48 min.
- User reports that no node has completed yet.
- For comparison, the historical NtSide=0 run completed in ~65.4 h; current elapsed time is already ~64% of that historical full-run wallclock.
- The prior ~2.11x C1 speedup number was an idealized estimate from the observed x8 path, not a completion-time prediction; the current run has not yet demonstrated that speedup.
- This observation alone does not distinguish slow progress from a stall. Do not infer hang/failure without current n6_des.out/process evidence.
- Next: read current FAST_C1 n6_des.out tail + process state, determine latest pseudo-time/anode voltage, confirm rejected attempts cap at 15, and measure progress rate before deciding whether to continue/stop.
- Research strategy remains staged: do not plan brute-force full 0→5 V for every Project A/B parameter point.

# 2026-10-04 — FAST_C1 exact source install PASS

- exact C1 source SHA-256 f62eab51816ba21a9fba6f9d26ef39606ea76b17c2a522153d4b45ed8cf27f93 confirmed in separate FAST_C1 project.

# 2026-10-04 — Claude B0 review: C1 unchanged, A1'/A1'' added

- C1 source unchanged: SHA-256 `f62eab51816ba21a9fba6f9d26ef39606ea76b17c2a522153d4b45ed8cf27f93`; `Iterations=15`.
- correction: ~4.33 V is the first rejected attempt where Newton count changes 50->15, not a trajectory divergence.
- A1': accepted-step sequence + rejection points should match over the observed overlap; unexplained mismatch = UNEXPECTED.
- A1'': every C1 rejection must show `#iterations larger than 15.`; 50 means cap not applied -> stop.
- A3/A4: printed-precision identity expected on observed overlap; 1e-3 / 1 mV are outer limits.
- new audit tool SHA-256 `9a935633e92bc55fa86849b6988b60a8a8ee55f637387ced62721d9f6267d281`; synthetic selftest passed.
- observed raw retry/rejected dt examples are ~0.5; full 285-event CSV ratio verification remains pending because the CSV was not included in the review package.
- patch-equivalent commit: `ace056fcb01d2e6e785dbee08a213e1148d6be35`.
- next: separate FAST C1 preprocess gate, then NtSide=0 B1 benchmark; live x6/x7/x8 untouched.

# 2026-10-04 sequence correction — FAST coding starts now

Copy x8 golden reference has been frozen. The next task is to build a separate numerical-only FAST_BASELINE and benchmark the first solver change against Copy x8.

Clean-account reproduction remains mandatory before final FAST baseline freeze / Project A-B production, but it is not a blocker for writing and short-benchmarking the FAST code.

Priority:
1. obtain/use exact Copy x8 editable source
2. create separate FAST_BASELINE
3. first candidate = Newton iteration/cutback policy only
4. short benchmark against Copy x8
5. accept/reject by runtime + physical/numerical equivalence
6. reproduce the accepted FAST deck on both accounts before production

---

# 2026-10-04 FAST baseline handoff

**Current task:** freeze Copy x8 as the golden local reference, then reproduce preprocessing in Lee Taek Gyu's clean account before any full FAST solve.

**Newest confirmed repository action:**
- `CMP/FAST_BASELINE_REPRO_PROTOCOL.md` added.
- `CMP/tcad/capture_reference_snapshot.sh` added.
- Public GitHub `CMP/tcad/CURRENT` is still not the authoritative Copy x8 running source.

**Immediate blocker:**
Existing local reference package `~/CMP_REFERENCE_20261004.tgz` is recorded as missing the exact editable SDevice source `sd_fdiv_des.cmd`. This source must be added locally and hashed before clean-account reproduction.

**Next:**
1. Complete Copy x8 local snapshot with exact source.
2. Generate SHA-256 manifest.
3. In clean account, preprocess only / early initialization.
4. Diff `pp1_dvs.cmd`, `pp6_des.cmd`, `pp6_des.par`; compare mesh hash/statistics.
5. Only after reproducibility gate passes, create numerical-only FAST branch.

**Do not change:** Common Baseline geometry, Nt/Et/sigma, 5 nm sidewall damage width, common A/B physics.

## 2026-09-29 — JuSubin active run direct evidence: Node 6 alive, high-bias convergence slowdown

- Direct file evidence: active output is `n6_des.out` (Node 6), superseding the earlier Node-19 inference.
- pseudo-time ≈0.93254, equivalent to ≈4.66 V on the known 0→5 V transient ramp.
- A BE step exceeded 50 Newton iterations, was rejected, then automatically retried with a smaller timestep (~8.67e-06).
- One failed attempt cost ~1244 s wallclock, dominated by solve time (~999 s).
- Status: RUNNING, not hung at the captured moment; repeated high-bias cutbacks are the present runtime bottleneck.
- Next check: confirm continued pseudo-time advance and timestep recovery before considering any restart or solver change.

## 2026-09-29 — JuSubin 3-day Workbench status screenshot

- OBSERVED: selected upper SDevice node reports `Status: waiting`; it has not started solving.
- Lower branch Node 19 appears running in Workbench, but actual solver progress is not proven from topology alone.
- Runtime blocker is now split into (1) scheduler/resource waiting for one branch and (2) unknown progress/hang status for the active branch.
- Next evidence: Node 19 Job Log + last lines/timestamps of `n19_des.out`.
- Do not abort/restart or modify baseline physics solely from this screenshot.

# LIVE AI STATE

## 2026-09-28 — CRITICAL SOURCE SYNC GAP FOUND

- GitHub Issue #7 and JuSubin timeline contain Final SDevice v1.2 progress.
- Actual `CMP/tcad/CURRENT/sdevice2_defect_on.cmd` is still an older stale deck and does NOT contain the v1.2 intermediate TDR save workflow.
- Gmail notifications are GitHub Issue #7 notifications and are consistent with the logged progress; they do not prove the actual code file was synchronized.
- Do NOT overwrite CURRENT from snippets or memory.
- Blocker: recover exact full user-provided Final SDevice v1.1/v1.2 source, then synchronize it.
- Current final-code provenance is therefore UNRESOLVED until that exact source is committed.



## 2026-09-26 — deadline mode

- User needs baseline + PPT today.
- Full 5 V NtSide=1e18 completion is not expected today based on historical multi-day runtime.
- Today deliverable: source/parameter freeze, clean preprocess comparison, successful trap-on initialization/early solve, and presentation-ready baseline evidence.
- Full same-revision NtSide=0 vs 1e18 electrical comparison remains pending and must not be presented as completed.


## 2026-09-26 — exact fix selected

- Proposed minimal edit: move Mg incomplete ionization from global Physics to p-GaN regions only.
- Do not alter Thermionic, trap parameters, Plot, Math, Solve, or geometry.
- After edit, rerun both NtSide=0 and 1e18 from the same frozen source/PAR revision for final comparison.


## 2026-09-26 — fair-comparison correction

- Node6 pp6_des.par and Node12 pp12_des.par are different revisions.
- Node6 uses generic P/N dopant ionization species; Node12 uses pMagnesiumActiveConcentration.
- Existing Node6 vs current/fixed Node12 is not a valid final NtSide-only comparison.
- Final baseline must freeze one source + parameter-file revision and rerun both NtSide=0 and 1e18.
- Node12-only fix remains diagnostic only.


## 2026-09-26 — Mg incomplete-ionization mismatch found

- pp12_des.par has Mg ionization parameters only under Material=GaN for pMagnesiumActiveConcentration.
- No InGaN ionization parameters are present.
- Node12 fails immediately after missing Mg incomplete-ionization parameter messages in InGaN QWs.
- Current source activates Mg incomplete ionization globally.
- Strong root-cause candidate: model/parameter material-scope mismatch.
- Proposed minimal fix: region-scope IncompleteIonization to Clean/DmgL/DmgR pGaN only; keep traps/Thermionic/Plot unchanged.
- Confirmation requires Node12 re-preprocess + initialization rerun.


## 2026-09-26 — full source inspection result

- Current SDevice source has no NtSide-dependent conditional preprocessing.
- NtSide only controls trap Conc.
- Current source always includes Thermionic + species-selected Mg IncompleteIonization + expanded Plot.
- Successful Node6 pp6 lacks those items, so Node6 is historical/stale relative to current source revision.
- Existing Node6 and current Node12 are not a clean same-source NtSide-only comparison.
- Node12 failure remains strongly tied to Mg incomplete-ionization initialization in InGaN.
- Next: inspect pp12_des.par Ionization/Magnesium/InGaN blocks before editing or rerunning.


## 2026-09-26 — Node 12 failure reproduced

- Node 12-only rerun fails again.
- Failure is reproducible.
- Same-source NtSide split is user-confirmed.
- Most likely next discriminators: NtSide-dependent preprocessing vs stale/cached Node 6 preprocess from an older source revision.
- Do not rerun or edit baseline physics until original source conditional logic/provenance is inspected.


## 2026-09-26 — correction: same source, NtSide-only split confirmed by user

- User states Node 6 and Node 12 used the same source; only NtSide=0 vs 1e18 was split.
- Prior proposed physics cleanup is retracted pending source inspection.
- pp6/pp12 differences may come from NtSide-dependent preprocessing or node/input version behavior.
- Do not edit Thermionic/IncompleteIonization/Plot yet.
- Next: inspect original sd_fdiv_des.cmd for parameter-dependent conditionals and source provenance.


## 2026-09-26 — Node 6/12 exact diff found

- Successful Node 6 and failed Node 12 are not NtSide-only decks.
- Extra Node12-only changes: `Thermionic`, species-selected `IncompleteIonization`, and four extra Plot fields.
- Intended difference: trap Conc 0 vs 1e18.
- Current failure therefore cannot yet be blamed on NtSide=1e18 alone.
- Proposed next: restore Node 6 Physics/Plot in original SDevice source, keep only NtSide=1e18, verify preprocessed diff, rerun.
- Status: PROPOSED FIX / UNCONFIRMED until rerun.


## 2026-09-26 — failed Node 12 deck captured

- Node 12 has `Thermionic` and `IncompleteIonization(Dopants="pMagnesiumActiveConcentration")`.
- Sidewall traps are 1e18 across pGaN/EBL/barriers/QWs/nGaN.
- Plot block is expanded with trap/SRH/Mg outputs.
- This differs from synchronized baseline record; possible deck drift beyond NtSide.
- Next: exact successful Node 6 pp6_des.cmd diff before any correction.


## 2026-09-26 — baseline branch comparison status

- NtSide=0 Node 6: CONFIRMED normal completion to 5 V; TDR written; wallclock ~65.4 h.
- NtSide=1e18 Node 12: SDevice exit(1) during initialization.
- Success log has no `mMagnesiumActiveConcentration` warning; failed log does.
- Strong correlated difference, but root cause not yet proven.
- Next action: diff `pp6_des.cmd/par` vs `pp12_des.cmd/par` before any physics change.


## 2026-09-26 — Node 12 des.log comparison needed

- Failed `n12_des.log` terminates immediately after InGaN Mg incomplete-ionization parameter messages, then returns licenses.
- No normal solver start is visible.
- Causality is unresolved.
- Highest-priority discriminator: compare the successful NtSide=0 node log for the exact same message.
- Do not alter baseline physics until this comparison is done.


## 2026-09-26 — Node 12 Find Error exhausted

- Find Error output reaches `**** End` with warnings only; no explicit fatal/root cause visible.
- The warnings concern E0 anisotropy and missing Mg incomplete-ionization parameters in InGaN.
- Their causal role is unproven.
- Highest-priority next evidence: `n12_des.log` bottom, then `n12_des.sta`.
- Status remains UNRESOLVED.


## 2026-09-26 — Node 12 failure location narrowed further

- Workbench preprocessing: successful.
- `pp12_des.cmd` / `pp12_des.par`: generated.
- SDevice command launched: `sdevice --max_threads 4 pp12_des.cmd`.
- SDevice returned `exit(1)` shortly after launch.
- Failure is therefore inside SDevice initialization/model setup, not SWB preprocessing/dependency.
- Root cause still UNRESOLVED.
- Next: use **Find Error** / explicit error search in `n12_des.err`.


## 2026-09-26 — Node 12 local.err result

- `n12_local.err`: `Job failed` / `child process exited abnormally` / `gjob exits with status 1`.
- This is a generic wrapper-level failure, not the root cause.
- Root cause remains UNRESOLVED.
- Next evidence: Node 12 Job Log bottom; then `n12_des.job` / `n12_des.sta`.
- Do not alter Common Baseline physics yet.


## 2026-09-26 — Ju Subin Node 12 failure narrowed

- `NtSide=1e18` failed Node = 12.
- `n12_des.err` visible messages are warnings; no fatal cause yet observed.
- `n12_des.out` ends during initialization/license return, without normal SDevice completion text.
- No TDR/PLT visible in Node 12 output list.
- Priority next evidence: `n12_local.err`, then Workbench Job Log.
- Status: UNRESOLVED; do not change baseline physical parameters yet.


## 2026-09-26 — 주수빈 baseline split-run 확인

- OBSERVED: `NtSide=0` run 정상 완료.
- OBSERVED: `NtSide=1e18` run failed.
- Cause: 아직 UNRESOLVED.
- Immediate next action: failed 1e18 SDevice node의 `*.err`와 `*.out` 마지막 구간을 확인해 최초 실패 원인을 식별.
- Do not change Common Baseline physical parameters before log-based diagnosis.


Last update: 2026-09-21
Primary worker: 이택규
Current phase: Phase 0 — Common Baseline validation
Current task: SDevice2 → SVisual2 TDR output/linkage debugging

## Parallel worker — 주수빈

**OBSERVED from shared project conversation:** 주수빈은 Common Baseline 관련 메인 SDevice 및 관련 코드를 최종 수정했다고 보고했고, 장시간 simulation 전에 Project A/B 공통 baseline 적합성을 마지막으로 검토 중이다.

Planned first runs:
- `NtSide=0`
- `NtSide=1e18`

Reported compute cost:
- 약 3일 / run

Verification boundary:
- 주수빈 측 최신 전체 코드와 새 simulation 결과는 이 sync 시점에 GitHub에서 직접 확인되지 않음.
- 따라서 코드 정확성/성공 여부는 아직 CONFIRMED 아님.

## One-line handoff

**SDevice2(Node 9)는 solver 종료까지 갔지만 SVisual2(Node 10)가 기대하는 `n9_des.tdr`이 Node 9 Output Files에서 보이지 않아 로드에 실패한 상태다. 다음 AI는 trap physics를 건드리지 말고 실제 preprocessed Plot filename부터 확인해야 한다.**

## Current blocker

SVisual2 error:

```text
File 'n9_des.tdr' could not be loaded.
```

SVisual2 currently constructs:

```tcl
set tdrfile n@previous@_des.tdr
load_file $tdrfile -name $dname2
```

Node 10 previous node = 9.

## OBSERVED evidence

1. Node 9 `n9_des.out` ends with:

```text
Sentaurus Device simulation finished
Good Bye !
```

Therefore the observed Node 9 run did not terminate with a solver fatal error.

2. Node 9 Explorer Output Files screenshot showed:

```text
n9_des.err
n9_des.job
n9_des.out
n9_des.sta
n9_local.err
pp9_des.cmd
pp9_des.par
```

`n9_des.tdr` was not visible in that screenshot.

3. The Node 9 output also displayed the Plot variable list, including:
- SRHRecombination
- RadiativeRecombination
- AugerRecombination
- TotalRecombination
- Current / eCurrent / hCurrent

4. Earlier SVisual2 Tcl mistakes already resolved:
- `create_plot -2d` invalid
- `@node|sdevice@` invalid in this flow
- SVisual2 must not contain an SDevice `Plot { ... }` block

## CURRENT GitHub code

Read these exact files before proposing edits:

- `CMP/tcad/CURRENT/sdevice2_defect_on.cmd`
- `CMP/tcad/CURRENT/svisual2_maps.tcl`
- `CMP/tcad/CURRENT/svisual1_iv.tcl`

SDE and SDevice1 latest full source are NOT yet synchronized.
JuSubin latest modified full code is also NOT yet synchronized.

## Next diagnostic — highest priority

Open `pp9_des.cmd` and inspect the preprocessed `File { ... }` block.

Need exact values of:

```text
Grid =
Parameters =
Plot =
Current =
Output =
```

Then compare the actual preprocessed `Plot = "..."` filename against Node 9 Output Files.

### Decision logic

- If a TDR exists under a different name → fix SVisual2 filename/reference only.
- If `Plot=` points to expected TDR but no TDR exists → diagnose why the SDevice run did not emit the device plot file.
- Do not modify Nt/Et/sigma/damage width while diagnosing this.

## Do NOT change

- Nt = 1e18 cm^-3 nominal Defect ON
- Et = Ev + 0.75 eV
- sigma_n = sigma_p = 1e-15 cm^2
- damage width = 5 nm
- Kou-based vertical epitaxy
- mesa = 4 µm representative modeling choice
- common contacts/physics for A/B comparison

## Known caution from previous ChatGPT attempts

Several trap-output keywords were previously proposed in bulk without confirming T-2022.03 support. Do not reintroduce unverified keywords by guess.

The original synchronized SDevice2 deck contains `SRHRecombination`; the fact that it was not visible in one SVisual scalar list does NOT by itself prove that the keyword is invalid.

## Goal after blocker is solved

1. Load Defect-ON TDR in SVisual2
2. Inspect actual available scalar names
3. Validate sidewall-localized recombination/trap effect
4. Compare Defect OFF vs ON
5. Continue Nt / mesa-size / mesh convergence validation


## 2026-09-22 parallel update — 주수빈 runtime

- Node 6 SDevice NtSide split run이 18시간 이상 실행 중.
- OBSERVED: 직전 BE step은 정상 수렴 완료, total wallclock 약 3563.68 s (~59 min/step).
- 다음 BE step은 약 0.0766738 → 0.0776738, Stepsize=1e-3로 계속 진행 중.
- 현재 증거만으로는 hang/fatal이 아니라 매우 느린 진행으로 판단.
- 주수빈 다음 우선 확인: pp6_des.cmd Solve block의 최종 목표와 step-control 설정을 읽어 총 step 수/예상 runtime 산정.


### 2026-09-22 runtime diagnosis confirmed
- pp6_des.cmd Transient: InitialStep=1e-5, MinStep=1e-9, MaxStep=1e-3, Increment=1.2, Goal anode=5.0 V.
- Log cross-check: pseudo-time ~0.0766738 corresponds to anode ~0.3834 V, matching 5*time.
- Therefore MaxStep=1e-3 corresponds to ~5 mV maximum bias increment.
- Current point leaves roughly 923–924 accepted steps minimum to reach 5 V.
- Using the latest observed ~3564 s/step as a crude extrapolation gives ~38 days remaining; actual cost can vary with bias.
- Treat current JuSubin blocker as numerical step strategy/computational cost, not SDE/SDevice dependency failure.


### Runtime diagnosis refinement
- User reports the pre-final-edit version of nearly the same deck completed in ~3 days.
- Therefore MaxStep=1e-3 explains a large step count but is not established as the new slowdown cause.
- If old/new step-control is the same, prioritize comparing per-step solve cost and rejected/cutback steps, then mesh size, Physics/Traps application scope, and Math solver settings.
- The prior ~38-day estimate is only a crude extrapolation from one slow step, not a reliable ETA.


### 2026-09-22 identical-bias comparison
- Old run at anode ~0.3834 V: Total 177.47 s (Assembly 64.84 s, Solve 108.74 s).
- Current run at same accepted anode ~0.3834 V: Total 3563.68 s (Assembly 598.77 s, Solve 2928.83 s).
- Current accepted-step cost is ~20.1x old at the same bias.
- Root cause is therefore narrowed to per-step computational cost, not merely MaxStep/step count.
- Next: compare mesh/grid/unknown statistics, Physics/Traps scope, and Math/solver settings old vs current.


### 2026-09-22 correction — same-file early vs late stage
- The 123–177 s logs around 0.30–0.3834 V are NOT verified as an old 3-day run; they are from the current Node 6 `n6_des.out` early section.
- Current run early: 0.0756738→0.0766738 reached ~0.3834 V in Total 177.47 s.
- A later screen from the same current run showed ~0.3834 V with Total 3563.68 s.
- Therefore prior "old vs current 20.1x" conclusion is invalid.
- Highest priority: determine whether the same pseudo-time/voltage ramp occurs in multiple Transient/Solve stages. Search all `Transient(` in pp6_des.cmd and locate `3563.68` / repeated `0.0766738` in n6_des.out.


### 2026-09-22 re-correction — old run confirmed by user
- User explicitly confirmed the 177.47 s / ~0.3834 V screenshot was from the older node that completed in ~3 days.
- Restore valid comparison:
  - old: Total 177.47 s (Assembly 64.84 s, Solve 108.74 s)
  - current: Total 3563.68 s (Assembly 598.77 s, Solve 2928.83 s)
  - current is ~20.1x slower per accepted step at the same anode voltage.
- Prior "same current run repeated stage" correction is retracted.
- Next: diff old vs current Math/solver, Physics/Traps scope, and mesh/unknown statistics.


### 2026-09-22 old 3-day full deck captured
- Old preprocessed `pp6_des.cmd` provided in full.
- All DmgL/R trap blocks have `Conc=0`; this is an NtSide=0 case.
- Old numerical stepping: InitialStep=1e-5, MinStep=1e-9, MaxStep=1e-3, Increment=1.2, Goal anode=5 V — same as the slow current Solve block already observed.
- Old Math signature: 4 threads, Digits=5, ErrRef=1e4, RHSMin=1e-3, BE, ExtendedPrecision(80), Blocked + ILS(22), gmres(100), tolrel=1e-10, ilut(1e-8,-1).
- Priority: verify current slow node's actual trap Conc. Only compare runtime directly if current is also NtSide=0.


## 2026-10-06 — FAST_C2 half-domain / selective-mesh direction accepted

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: DECISION / IMPLEMENTATION CANDIDATE
- user accepted a runtime-optimization branch using half-domain symmetry plus localized fine mesh.
- keep current Node 6/12 full-device runs as reference evidence.
- candidate only: half-domain is allowed only after confirming left-right symmetry of geometry, doping, contacts, traps and BCs in the actual SDE source.
- preserve fine resolution at the 5 nm sidewall-damage region and other solution-critical interfaces/high-field zones; coarsen only remote homogeneous bulk with graded transitions.
- publication gate: compare against full/fine reference at identical physics/bias, including current normalization and key spatial metrics, before adopting.
- immediate next step: recover/inspect exact running SDE source, then create separate FAST_C2 short benchmark.


## 2026-10-06 — Project B compatible with half-domain, but center active region remains mesh-critical

- Project B symmetric AlBarrier_L/R concept is compatible with half-domain if the actual SDE/contact/BC setup is mirror-symmetric.
- do not remove mesh from the retained center domain; only coarsen remote homogeneous bulk.
- Project B requires additional refinement at GaN/AlGaN lateral interfaces and barrier/MQW intersections, while the center MQW must remain adequately resolved for radiative/current-crowding metrics.
- adoption still gated by full/fine equivalence validation.


## 2026-10-06 — A/B half-domain + selective mesh formally recommended as validated candidate

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: REVIEWED / RECOMMENDED CANDIDATE
- A/B 모두 mirror symmetry가 actual SDE/contact/BC에서 확인되면 half-domain 적용 가능.
- retained center domain의 mesh는 제거하지 않고 remote homogeneous bulk만 graded coarsening.
- common fine zones: 5 nm sidewall damage, MQW, junction/heterointerfaces, high-field/depletion/contact edges.
- A-specific: refine Cedge/GaN:C boundary.
- B-specific: refine lateral AlGaN/GaN interface and barrier-MQW intersections; B has stricter interface-mesh need because band offsets/fields are primary mechanism.
- final adoption requires full/fine equivalence validation; current Node 6/12 reference runs remain preserved.


## 2026-10-06 — Half-domain preserves IQE ratio under mirror symmetry

- current CMP IQE metric: integrated Rrad / (Rrad + RSRH + RAuger) over an identical physical integration region.
- for an exactly mirror-symmetric device, each full-domain integrated recombination term is twice the half-domain term, so the factor of 2 cancels in IQE.
- half-domain is therefore valid for IQE comparison, provided symmetry and identical integration-region definitions hold.
- do not multiply IQE by 2; only absolute total current/recombination/power may require full-device symmetry scaling/2D normalization checks.


## 2026-10-06 — Recommended baseline strategy: physical 4 µm device, validated half-domain production model

- physical Common Baseline remains a 4.0 µm mesa.
- recommended computational representation, after validation: simulate only the 2.0 µm half-domain with centerline symmetry.
- retain full/fine runs as reference evidence; do not delete the full model from the methodology.
- validate symmetry-only change before mesh coarsening, then use the same validated half-domain mesh policy for Baseline/A/B production comparisons.
- IQE is compatible with the half-domain under exact symmetry; absolute totals still need normalization/symmetry scaling checks.


## 2026-10-09 11:30 KST update
- OBSERVED (user report): `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB` run completed overnight.
- Previous blocker "half+coarse transient still running" is cleared at report level.
- Verification gate remains: confirm final 0.3 V, no fatal termination, output artifacts, and extract runtime/I-V before treating the run as a validated result.


## 2026-10-09 11:30 KST priority
1. Verify completed `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB` terminal/log evidence: final 0.3 V, normal completion, no fatal/error, output files.
2. Extract total wallclock/runtime and I-V points from the completed half+coarse transient.
3. Check the `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB_Copy` QS smoke status/result separately.
4. Compare Half+coarse transient vs QS Copy, then against full FAST_C1 reference before adopting the fast branch for production A/B.


## 2026-10-09 — QS Copy early termination verified; original transient complete
- Original `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB` transient: CONFIRMED 0.300 V trace completion, 25019.43 s, 412K PLT / 15M TDR / 3.1M SAV. 0.3 V I-V examined but physically validated baseline not yet established.
- Separate `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB_Copy` QS: UNRESOLVED — SDevice `Step-size less than MinStep (step-size = 8.3986e-07)`; 18417.09 s and `Good Bye`, SAV/TDR written. Goal 0.3 V NOT confirmed. No comparable QS speedup conclusion.
- Next: QS n2_des.plt last accepted anode bias + last log step/retries/err; do not modify baseline or solver yet.


## 2026-10-09 — QS Copy last accepted bias determined
- 작업자: 이택규. OBSERVED from user-provided `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB_Copy/n2_des.plt` tail and `n2_des.log` grep.
- Last recorded QS pseudo-time: 6.43487876313307E-02; last anode OuterVoltage: 1.93046362893992E-02 V (0.0193046363 V; 19.3 mV, only ~6.435% of requested 0.3 V).
- Last log attempts at t=0.0643488 to 0.0643505 then terminated `Step-size less than MinStep (step-size = 8.3986e-07)`.
- QS runtime 18417.09 s but did NOT reach goal. Cannot compare as speedup to original transient that reached 0.3 V in 25019.43 s.
- Root numerical/physics trigger not yet established. Next: inspect QS log around lines 6900-7000 and `n2_des.err`; no blind MinStep or baseline modification.


## 2026-10-09 — QS Newton failure isolated
- Final attempted QS step `t=0.0643488→0.0643505`, Newton Poisson+electron+hole Bank/Rose hit Coupled limit 15, residual oscillated to ~1.26e8, final ~1.85e6; retry step 8.3986e-7 below MinStep 1e-6. Root numerical/physical trigger unresolved. Preserve completed transient and baseline. Next inspect actual active QS Math/Solve deck before any numerical-only pilot.


## 2026-10-09 — QS Copy active preprocess settings checked
- OBSERVED from semi437 `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB_Copy/pp2_des.cmd` grep supplied by Lee Taekgyu: Quasistationary begins line 589 (InitialStep=0.03, MinStep=1e-6, MaxStep=0.15). QS Coupled has `Iterations=15` line 601; Math `RHSMin=1e-3` line 510. Earlier `Coupled(Iterations=500, LineSearchDamping=1e-2)` around 570-572 appears in initial solve, another initial Coupled Iterations=100 at line 578.
- OBSERVED final QS failed Newton after 15 iterations and rejected halved step below MinStep; 0.0193046363 V last accepted. Specific nonlinear divergence trigger remains UNRESOLVED.
- Need inspect full surrounding Math/Solve 505-610 before attributing nonconvergence to damping, iteration cap, or other solver options. Avoid changing frozen Common Baseline, preserved transient results, or rerunning blindly.


## 2026-10-09 — QS Math/Solve complete context inspected
- 작업자: 이택규; OBSERVED from `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB_Copy/pp2_des.cmd` lines 505–530 and 565–610 supplied in chat.
- Math: `ErrRef(electron/hole)=1e4`, `RHSMin=1e-3`, `CheckRhsAfterUpdate`, `Transient=BE`, `ExtendedPrecision(80)`, `TensorGridAniso(aniso)`, `ComputeDopingConcentration`, `Method=Blocked`, `SubMethod=ILS(set=22)`.
- Solve initialization: Poisson `Coupled(Iterations=500 LineSearchDamping=1e-2)`; carrier-coupled zero-bias `Coupled(Iterations=100)`.
- QS: `InitialStep=0.03 MinStep=1e-6 MaxStep=0.15 Increment=1.5 Decrement=2.0 Goal(anode)=0.3 V`, inner `Coupled(Iterations=15)` over Poisson/Electron/Hole with NO explicit LineSearchDamping.
- The initial Poisson damping does not imply the QS inner Coupled has damping. Hypothesis to test: QS Newton stabilization numerics may improve convergence; no direct causal verification yet. Math `Transient=BE` does not replace QS Solve command.
- IMPORTANT discrepancy: code comment says 0.3V checkpoint written only after sweep completed, but actual logs prove Save ran after QS `Step-size less than MinStep` termination at last accepted V=0.019304636 V. Thus `n2_qs0p3_ckpt` is NOT a verified 0.3V checkpoint; never use filename as endpoint evidence.
- Next before code edits: compare numeric & physics control lines of original transient `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB/pp2_des.cmd` with QS Copy actual deck. No solver setting modified yet.


## 2026-10-09 — Original transient vs QS Copy settings compared
- 작업자: 이택규; 상태: OBSERVED from user-shared original `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB/pp2_des.cmd` grep and previous QS Copy preprocessed deck.
- Both original transient and QS Copy: `ErrRef(electron/hole)=1e4`, `RHSMin=1e-3`, `CheckRhsAfterUpdate`, startup Poisson `Coupled(Iterations=500, LineSearchDamping=1e-2)`, startup carrier `Coupled(Iterations=100)`, sweep inner `Coupled(Iterations=15)` without explicit sweep-local damping.
- Original transient: `Transient` with InitialStep=1e-5, MinStep=1e-9, MaxStep=1e-3, Increment=1.2 (actual final 0.3V result was confirmed earlier). QS Copy: `Quasistationary` InitialStep=0.03, MinStep=1e-6, MaxStep=0.15, Increment=1.5, Decrement=2.0, Goal(anode)=0.3V. Time coordinates have different meanings and cannot be compared directly as numerical step sizes.
- Correction: lack of explicit sweep-local LineSearchDamping is NOT a unique QS setting and cannot by itself explain the divergent convergence. Underlying cause still UNRESOLVED. Other Physics settings and actual complete original Goal/Decrement block not yet side-by-side audited.
- The original source header comments say 0-4.0V/4.0-5.0V, whereas current observed result was a 0.3V smoke; must read executable original Goal in `pp2_des.cmd` to resolve the potentially stale header comment.
- Next: inspect original `pp2_des.cmd` lines 583–615 for actual executable voltage Goal and step-control; preserve both results and Common Baseline. No code changes.


## 2026-10-09 — Original transient executable Goal confirmed (smoke only)
- 작업자: 이택규. OBSERVED from user terminal `../JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB/pp2_des.cmd` lines 580–615 (actual executable block): `Transient(InitialTime=0.0, FinalTime=0.06, InitialStep=1e-5, MinStep=1e-9, MaxStep=1e-3, Increment=1.2, Goal{Name="anode", Voltage=0.3})` and inner `Coupled(Iterations=15){Poisson Electron Hole}`, followed by `Save(FilePrefix="n2_smoke_ckpt_0p3V")`.
- Therefore full 0.3 V endpoint was explicitly intended for this short syntax/mesh/physics smoke; earlier header comments describing 0–4.0 V/4.0–5.0 V are NOT the executable sweep configuration for Node 2. Previous comment/Goal discrepancy resolved.
- Original Transient smoke successfully finished 0.3 V; does not establish 3–5 V forward I–V, IQE or half+coarse equivalence to full/fine reference. QS Copy stalled at 0.019304636 V and remains an experimental numerical branch.
- Decision: preserve both existing projects and all outputs; prioritize preparing a separate, reviewed high-bias Transient branch for actual LED operation, only after source/provenance, bias plan, solver stability and half-vs-full validation gates. Do NOT modify original 0.3 V smoke or automatically launch 5 V.


## 2026-10-09 — Filesystem copy exists; SWB open not yet checked
- 이택규 executed `cp -a JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`, subsequent ls confirmed target directory and `cmp` between original/copied SDevice source produced no differences.
- Bash-style conditional produced `if: Expression Syntax.` in current C-shell-like terminal; standalone copy command worked.
- Next verify original/copied hidden `.project` file and project directory content, then open copied project in SWB Projects browser; preserve original, do not run simulations or edit high-bias deck yet.


## 2026-10-09 — SWB `.project` files verified in original and 5V test copy
- 작업자: 이택규; OBSERVED in user terminal `ls -la JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB/.project JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/.project` from `myproject`.
- Both `.project` files exist, zero bytes, each mode `-rw-r--r--`, timestamp Oct 8 16:58; the 5V test is an actual copy with SDevice source previously compared identical.
- This supports SWB project marker preservation, but SWB GUI successful open, flow nodes, and project paths are NOT yet confirmed.
- Next: in existing SWB GUI locate/open `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`, screenshot the project flow and verify independent folder before any source edits, preprocessing or Run/F7. Original smoke project remains preserved.


## 2026-10-09 — 5V test SWB flow screenshot inspected
- 작업자: 이택규; status OBSERVED from screenshot of SWB project table.
- Screenshot visibly contains SDE and SDEVICE tool columns, one scenario row, parameter NtSide=0, and `No Variables` section. SVisual node is not visible in the cropped image.
- Project name/title bar is not shown in this crop, so cannot yet independently verify screenshot refers to `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`, despite user's prior report that copied project opened.
- No evidence of 5V code modifications or new node execution. Next: read copied `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/sdevice_des.cmd` lines 565-620 from user's terminal, check the editable original Solve block and bias/ramp before safe separate 5V branch changes. Do not press F7 before verified preprocess.


## 2026-10-09 — Copied 5V_TEST SDevice source Solve confirmed (OBSERVED; 5V change PROPOSED)
- Worker 이택규 provided terminal `sed -n '565,620p' sdevice_des.cmd` from `/user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`.
- Actual copied editable Solve source is still original 0.3V transient smoke: initial Poisson Coupled 500 iterations with `LineSearchDamping=1e-2`; initial Poisson/Electron/Hole Coupled 100; `Transient(InitialTime=0.0, FinalTime=0.06, InitialStep=1e-5, MinStep=1e-9, MaxStep=1e-3, Increment=1.2, Goal{Name=anode Voltage=0.3})` and inner `Coupled(Iterations=15)`; `Save(FilePrefix="n@node@_smoke_ckpt_0p3V")`.
- PROPOSED minimal 5V feasibility trial in copy only: preserve 5V/time-unit ramp (original 0.3/0.06=5) by considering FinalTime=1.0 alongside Goal=5.0 and distinct save suffix, leaving physics/mesh and numerical controls unchanged initially. This is not an approved or executed code modification or a demonstrated solver convergence strategy.
- Must back up copy source and preflight SWB re-preprocess before Run; high-voltage numerical and physical validation remain open. Original and separate QS Copy results protected. Important: Save can occur after unsuccessful sweep, so checkpoint name alone cannot confirm 5V.


## 2026-10-09 — Half 5V test SDevice edit performed in copied SWB project
- 작업자: 이택규. OBSERVED from terminal in `/user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`: user ran `cp -p sdevice_des.cmd sdevice_des_0p3V_backup.cmd`, then `sed -i` replacing `FinalTime = 0.06` with `1.0`, `Goal Voltage = 0.3` with `5.0`, and `Save FilePrefix n@node@_smoke_ckpt_0p3V` with `n@node@_5V_ckpt`.
- Follow-up `grep -nE 'FinalTime|Voltage =|FilePrefix =' sdevice_des.cmd` confirmed line 587 FinalTime=1.0, line 597 Goal Voltage=5.0, line 608 new 5V Save prefix; initial electrode Voltage=0.0 appears at lines 38 and 43.
- Code modification is OBSERVED in the user's remote copied project, NOT yet synced as full source to GitHub. Backup command executed but exact backup-byte equality not independently checked. Original `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB` and QS Copy were not targeted.
- Numerical intent: preserve the old 5 V per time-unit voltage ramp by adjusting 0.3/0.06 to 5/1; note `Transient` time is physical simulation time and this is not a steady-state QS. Not yet validated for high-bias convergence/current/IQE. The old 0.3V smoke comment in source may remain stale.
- NEXT: in the copied SWB project select SDevice Node 2 and run Ctrl+P preprocessing only; check generated `pp2_des.cmd` for actual FinalTime=1.0, anode Goal Voltage=5.0, Save prefix and expected mesh/physics/NtSide before F7. Do NOT run 5V yet; check that copied project prep is independent from original.


## 2026-10-09 — 5V_TEST SDevice preprocess output verified
- 작업자: 이택규. OBSERVED from terminal `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/pp2_des.cmd` grep: executable `Transient(` line 585, `FinalTime=1.0` line 587, `Goal Voltage=5.0` line 597, generated Save prefix `n2_5V_ckpt` line 608. Initial anode/cathode electrode voltages remain 0.0 at lines 38/43.
- This confirms 5V edits propagated into a generated preprocessed deck. However, this grep alone does NOT verify output Grid file, effective `NtSide=0` trap substitution, preexisting copied results safety, full physics/solver correctness, or high-bias convergence. 5V SDevice run is NOT yet confirmed launched.
- NEXT before F7: check Grid and parameter/trap substitutions in `pp2_des.cmd`, check `n1_msh.tdr` and existing n2 outputs in copied project (preserve old results if present), then decide whether to start prolonged high-bias 5V transient. If future result Save executes after failed sweep, `n2_5V_ckpt` name alone does not establish 5 V reached.


## 2026-10-09 — Copied 5V test contains old 0.3 V node2 outputs: protect before Run
- 작업자: 이택규. OBSERVED user `ls -lh` in `/user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`: `n1_msh.tdr` 1.6M (Oct 8 18:08), `n2_des.log` 1.1M (Oct 9 01:39), `n2_des.plt` 412K (Oct 9 01:39), `n2_des.tdr` 15M (Oct 9 01:39).
- These outputs are inherited from the original 0.3V smoke folder by `cp -a`; they are NOT evidence that 5V has run. A new Node2 Run may overwrite/clear outputs. The original source 0.3V project exists separately.
- User did not include requested grep of preprocessed Grid/Parameter/Conc/RHSMin/Iterations in this message; settings not yet verified for 5V run.
- Next proposed: create a timestamped tar.gz snapshot of entire 5V_TEST directory from parent folder and confirm archive exists; then retrieve missing `pp2_des.cmd` Grid/trap/solver grep before deciding F7. Do not claim backup succeeded until terminal verifies. Preserve original smoke/QS branches.


## 2026-10-09 — 5V copied Half/Coarse transient backup and Grid/Trap preflight observed
- 작업자: 이택규; 상태: OBSERVED from user's terminal (archive integrity check pending; 5V run NOT YET observed).
- At `/user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject`, user executed `tar -czf JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST_pre5V_20261009.tar.gz JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`; `ls -lh` confirms archive 12M, timestamp Oct 9 11:25. This is an existing compressed project snapshot made *after* 5V source edits, containing copied old 0.3V outputs; not a verified successful 5V result. Archive contents/integrity have not yet been independently checked with `tar -tzf`.
- In copied project `pp2_des.cmd` grep: Grid=`n1_msh.tdr` line20; 12 displayed region-level `Conc=0` lines145–365; RHSMin=1e-3 line510; startup Coupled Iterations=500 and 100; sweep `Coupled(Iterations=15)` line600. Earlier pp2 verification showed executable Transient, FinalTime=1.0, Goal anode=5.0, Save prefix `n2_5V_ckpt`.
- Original 0.3V smoke and separate QS Copy preserved. Current blocker: archive integrity check and launching SDevice Node2 only in copied SWB; don't launch SDE or modify original. 5V high-bias numerical/physical validity, IQE, I-V, mesh/symmetry equivalence are not established. Allow initial run only as exploratory independent branch, with output/log monitoring and no runtime/accuracy promise.
- NEXT: `tar -tzf ../JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST_pre5V_20261009.tar.gz > /dev/null` and `echo $status` (C-shell-compatible; 0 expected); then copied SWB Node2 SDevice Run F7 only; inspect new n2_des.log/err after startup, verify no immediate failure and logs no longer Oct 9 01:39 copied outputs.


### 2026-10-09 archive check
- 이택규 verified tar listing of JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST_pre5V_20261009.tar.gz: C-shell status 0.
- 5V SDevice Node2 startup is now next; F7 launch not yet observed. Original projects preserved.


## 2026-10-09 — SWB copied 5V project GUI state ambiguous; do NOT clean node yet
- 작업자 이택규. OBSERVED screenshot: SWB title/path `/user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST` (T-2022.03), copied project selected in tree, SDE and SDEVICE stages present, NtSide=0, SDE/SDEVICE cells show `--` (no unambiguous running/completed status).
- User asks whether a job is already running and whether to Clean Up Node. No actual SDevice active-process, new log, or scheduler run evidence supplied. Inherited n2_des.* files are old 0.3V smoke results copied earlier.
- Guidance: hold Clean Up Node and F7 until check; cleanup can remove copied node outputs, possibly mesh/dependency and confuse active jobs. Ask user to run `ps -fu semi437 | grep '[s]device'`, `ls -lh --full-time n2_des.log`, `tail -n 12 n2_des.log` in 5V_TEST, then decide. Also if no sdevice process, SWB Scheduler could still have queued job; inspect scheduler status before cleanup.
- Archive tar integrity was confirmed (`tar -tzf`, status 0) and 5V preprocessed source verified, but run status currently UNKNOWN, not started claim.


## 2026-10-09 — 5V copied project Node2 not running; old 0.3V log confirmed
- 작업자: 이택규; OBSERVED user terminal from `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`.
- `ps -fu semi437 | grep '[s]device'` showed ONLY two old active sdevice processes: PID 69457 running `pp6_des.cmd` since Oct04, and PID 93915 running `pp12_des.cmd` since Oct06 (both 99% CPU). No `pp2_des.cmd` SDevice process present in this observed process list. A queued SWB job, if any, was not separately checked.
- `n2_des.log` mtime Oct 9 01:39:13 +0900; its tail says the *old original 0.3V smoke* completed with `Good Bye` Oct9 01:39:13, wallclock 25019.43 s and 2.61GB peak memory. This log was inherited by directory copy and is NOT a 5V result.
- Therefore no indication 5V SDevice Node2 has launched; do NOT Clean Up Node merely to start. Existing pre5V archive readable (tar listing status 0), pp2_des.cmd preprocessed 5V parameters confirmed earlier.
- NEXT: if concurrent machine/license resources are acceptable, select **only** SDevice Node2 in the SWB copied `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST` and run F7. Avoid SDE re-run. Monitor fresh `n2_des.log` timestamp and View Output; check convergence and actual attained anode voltage. CPU contention from pp6/pp12 may prolong 5V run. Do not mark 5V started/completed before evidence.


## 2026-10-09 11:33 KST — Copied Half 5V SDevice Node2 launched via SWB
- 작업자: 이택규. OBSERVED in user-supplied SWB Project Log screenshot for `/user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`: preprocessor successfully initialized, dependency on node 1 recognized, local submit for job 2, status changed ready -> pending -> running, `11:33:14 Oct 09 2026 job '2' <sdevice> started on host ...`.
- Correct project title/path visible and scenario NtSide=0. This establishes SWB submitted/launched Node2 at the recorded instant, but DOES NOT establish process still alive, solver convergence, 5V reached, I-V or IQE. No new `n2_des.log` contents received since launch.
- Preflight had verified pp2 Transient FinalTime=1.0 Goal anode=5.0V, Grid=n1_msh.tdr, 12 displayed Conc=0, RHSMin=1e-3, inner Coupled Iterations=15, and readable 12MB pre5V archive. Existing unrelated pp6 and pp12 SDevice jobs observed on the same account immediately prior.
- NEXT: do not Clean Up Node or press F7 again. In copied test directory check `ps -fu semi437 | grep '[s]device'`, `ls -lh --full-time n2_des.log`, `tail -n 20 n2_des.log` to confirm fresh process/log and whether simulation is progressing. Avoid interrupting unrelated pp6/pp12 and original smoke/QS projects.

## 2026-10-09 14:29:52 KST — Half+Coarse 5V TEST Node2 COMPLETE (OBSERVED)

- OBSERVED source: user-provided terminal in `/user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`, `tail -n 40 n2_des.log` after run. Final anode voltage `5.000E+00 V`, anode electron `2.781E-13`, hole `1.420E-11`, total current `1.448E-11` (terminal output units require current-normalization audit). `Finished, because... Curve trace finished.`, `Sentaurus Device simulation finished`, `Good Bye !` at 2026-10-09 14:29:52 KST.
- OBSERVED files written per log: `n2_5V_ckpt_des.sav`, `n2_5V_ckpt_circuit_des.sav`, `n2_des.tdr`. `wallclock=10596.76 s` (2 h 56 m 36.76 s), total CPU 30641.23 s, peak memory 2.97 GB. `ps` showed only pp6 PID 69457 and pp12 PID 93915; no active pp2 at check.
- Proven: copied **Half+Coarse NtSide=0** Transient Node2 reached 5V and terminated normally. Not proven: publication-grade/common damaged NtSide=1e18 baseline, physical I-V/current-density validity, full-vs-half equivalence, IQE/optical emission, extracted current units, or A/B improvements. Do not treat save filename alone as 5V evidence; here independently supported by final 5V terminal row + normal curve trace.
- Previous 116h extrapolated runtime and 3–7+day planning range are superseded by the **measured 10596.76 s** for this run; reason for fast runtime relative to old 0.3V smoke remains unverified. Do not infer speedup or solver equivalence without source/deck/log comparison.
- NEXT: preserve 5V outputs/checkpoints and current reference pp6/pp12 jobs; inspect `n2_des.plt` for full I-V, ensure actual postprocess unit/AreaFactor/2D symmetry normalization, compare intermediate MQW Rrad/SRH/Auger and carrier/injection with full/fine at matched bias/current; then separate nominal `NtSide=1e18` damage case after controlled preprocess/short-run gate. Project A/B production remains NO-GO pending existing audit.

## 2026-10-09 — Half+Coarse 5V_TEST output artifact and PLT schema gate (OBSERVED / partial PASS)

- 이택규 user terminal in `/user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`: `ls -lh --full-time` confirms `n2_des.plt` 412K (mtime 14:29:52), `n2_des.tdr` 16M (14:29:53), `n2_5V_ckpt_des.sav` 3.2M (14:29:50), and `n2_5V_ckpt_circuit_des.sav` 306B (14:29:50). Artifacts correspond temporally to observed normal 5V finish at 14:29:52; contents of .tdr/.sav not independently decoded.
- `head -n 30 n2_des.plt` confirms `DF-ISE text` and 17 datasets: time, cathode/anode outer/inner voltage, quasi-Fermi, displacement current, electron/hole/total current, and charge. Full PLT data trajectory/last row NOT YET PARSED; do not confuse schema presence with verified IV physical correctness.
- `grep -ni 'AreaFactor' pp2_des.cmd pp2_des.par` returns `grep: pp2_des.par: No such file or directory`; no `AreaFactor` match printed for `pp2_des.cmd`. Missing `pp2_des.par` is a parameter-path audit item, not evidence of SDevice failure. Actual parameter reference and 2D area/current normalization still UNRESOLVED.
- NEXT (read-only): parse PLT as 17-field data records, report first/last V and current, full I–V and voltage monotonicity; inspect `Parameters` reference from `pp2_des.cmd` and actual `*.par` files before any A/cm2 normalization. Preserve outputs and other pp6/pp12 jobs.

## 2026-10-09 — Half+Coarse 5V_TEST PLT 1023-point I–V readout and Parameters path confirmed (OBSERVED)

- 작업자: 이택규. User ran read-only awk across `n2_des.plt` DF-ISE Data with 17 fields per record: `ROWS=1023`, `REMAINDER=0`, first anode OuterVoltage 0 V, last exactly 5.00000000000000E+00 V; last anode TotalCurrent (raw printed) 1.44801646079583E-11. This confirms a fully parsed 17-column series from 0 to 5V but not yet its physical current units or validity.
- Sampled voltage/raw total current pairs: (0 V, -9.34556980161972E-27), (0.503368865 V, 5.81275673304787E-15), (1.003368865 V, 6.13100514338505E-15), (1.503368865 V, 7.84214693612489E-15), (2.003368865 V, 1.31567117783539E-14), (2.503368865 V, 2.84645414227297E-14), (3.003368865 V, 3.17582117791696E-14), (3.503368865 V, 3.28516927136479E-14), (4.003368865 V, 3.50552134304176E-14), (4.503368865 V, 3.69335070901735E-13), (5V, 1.44801646079583E-11). Sample points show pronounced rise above ~4V, not evidence of confirmed LED emission or normal operating current; full 1023-point monotonicity not checked.
- `pp2_des.cmd` File block points to `Grid="n1_msh.tdr"`, `Parameters="FASTC1_pp6_des.par"`, `Plot="n2_des.tdr"`, `Current="n2_des.plt"`, `Output="n2_des.log"`. User `find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.par'` returned `./FASTC1_pp6_des.par`. Therefore absent `pp2_des.par` is explained by correct alternate parameter filename. Parameter *contents*, AreaFactor absence across all active sources, radiative coefficient and steady-state-vs-transient interpretation not yet verified.
- Source header comments claim staged 0–4 / 4–5V with multiple checkpoint saves, but previous actual executable Solve was a single 0–5V transient and log showed end Save only; comments cannot substitute for active code. Do not assert multi-stage operation from comments.
- NEXT: read-only inspect `FASTC1_pp6_des.par`, actual `pp2_des.cmd` Physics/Plot and any AreaFactor; establish semiconductor radiative coefficient/output fields, 2D width and current scaling; then evaluate MQW Rrad/SRH/Auger and terminal carrier-current consistency using `n2_des.tdr`. Do not modify working code, clean up, or rerun as part of audit. NtSide=0 endpoint success does not validate damaged NtSide=1e18 or final common baseline.

## 2026-10-09 — Half+Coarse 5V endpoint contact-current components and recombination declarations (OBSERVED / emission UNRESOLVED)

- 작업자: 이택규. User provided direct terminal outputs from `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`: last DF-ISE PLT record `time=1.00000000000000E+00, V=5.00000000000000E+00`. Anode raw `DisplacementCurrent=3.29132361382365E-18`, `eCurrent=2.78143237811134E-13`, `hCurrent=1.42020180788235E-11`, `TotalCurrent=1.44801646079583E-11`. At final step, terminal displacement contribution is negligible relative to total; anode hole current dominates. This does NOT establish MQW hole injection or steady-state across complete device.
- Actual parameter linkage confirmed: `pp2_des.cmd` uses `Parameters="FASTC1_pp6_des.par"` and `find` locates that exact file. User `cat FASTC1_pp6_des.par` shows only `LatticeParameters`, `Thermionic Formula=1`, and GaN Mg active-species `Ionization`; **no explicit Radiative coefficient in this parameter file**. Material database / other effective settings may still supply parameters: do not infer radiative coefficient=0 from this absence.
- User `grep -niE 'AreaFactor|Radiative|SRH|Auger|Recombination|CurrentPlot' pp2_des.cmd FASTC1_pp6_des.par` shows SDevice Physics `Recombination(SRH(), Auger(), Radiative)` at pp2 lines ~78–84, and Plot datasets `SRHRecombination`, `RadiativeRecombination`, `AugerRecombination` ~398–408. No AreaFactor match in these two files. These are code/model/output declarations, **not proof that any MQW Rrad is positive, integrated, or emitted light**.
- Prior Synopsys T-2022.03 UG audit recorded in `LeeTaekGyu/TIMELINE.md` (2026-10-08; Device UG §16 pp.488–489) cautions non-GaAs radiative-coefficient default may be zero without override; need verify effective GaN/InGaN material coefficients instead of claiming emission. Material database not reviewed in this turn.
- Next: read-only inspect `pp2_des.cmd` Physics/Plot context and `n2_des.log` radiative/material parameter clues, then open final `n2_des.tdr` in SVisual and confirm fully visible `RadiativeRecombination` values inside `Clean_QW1`–`Clean_QW4`; compare SRH/Auger and carrier maps and, when validated, perform spatial integration. Current-density normalization/AreaFactor still unresolved; no code modified, no rerun.

## 2026-10-09 — 5V SVisual radiative field (OBSERVED)

- 이택규 screenshot shows positive RadiativeRecombination in final n2_des.tdr; plot max 7.483e19 cm^-3 s^-1, min about zero (-7.512e-34). Mesh 138194 elements / 65513 points.
- The high-rate thin layers have not been mapped to named Clean_QW1-4, so MQW emission, integrated rates and IQE remain unverified.
- NEXT: SVisual Regions tab identify QWs and probe rates; then SRH/Auger and material radiative coefficient. Preserve results.

## 2026-10-09 — 5V_TEST four InGaN Clean_QW local RadiativeRecombination Probe measurements (OBSERVED; IQE NOT YET)

- 작업자: 이택규. User supplied four direct Sentaurus Visual Probe screenshots in `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST` / `n2_des`, with scalar `RadiativeRecombination`, explicit zone label, x/y coordinates and Magnitude (cm^-3 s^-1, unit grounded in preceding SVisual legend).
- `Clean_QW1(InGaN)`: x=0.169818746552, y=0.560459877538, z=0, `Rrad=1.836010164996e+13`.
- `Clean_QW2(InGaN)`: x=0.194326754006, y=0.556958733616, z=0, `Rrad=3.558921779790e+12`.
- `Clean_QW3(InGaN)`: x=0.22058533342, y=0.56571159342, z=0, `Rrad=8.395713573050e+14`.
- `Clean_QW4(InGaN)`: x=0.245093340874, y=0.58321731303, z=0, `Rrad=7.094266327897e+18`.
- Result: **each of four named InGaN QWs contains a positive local Rrad point**, beyond mere output declaration or plot-wide maximum. The QW4 sampled point exceeds sampled other QW values by several orders of magnitude. HOWEVER: points differ in both vertical and lateral coordinates (x/y), so local values are **NOT** region-integrated emission, per-well averages or a verified QW4 total-emission dominance. Do not treat local peak, photon escape, IQE or material radiative coefficient as validated.
- Remaining: check SRH and Auger at the *same probe coordinates*, map Rrad spatially through each QW and perform mesh/region correct integrals, confirm 2D current normalization, injection/current plausibility and half-vs-full correspondence; NtSide=0 branch only. No new solver or source changes.

## 2026-10-09 — QW4 SRH point confirmed; coordinate mismatch with Rrad

- User SVisual Probe: Clean_QW4(InGaN), srhRecombination = 1.681637512936e22 cm^-3 s^-1 at (x,y)=(0.244864017914, 0.599783903626).
- Previous Clean_QW4 Rrad=7.094266327897e18 was at (0.245093340874, 0.58321731303). Same region, different position; direct pointwise SRH/Rrad comparison and IQE are not valid.
- NEXT: Probe SRH and Auger at the exact previous Rrad coordinate and validate integrated QW rates before estimating IQE. No code or model change.

## 2026-10-09 — 5V_TEST co-located Clean_QW4 Probe shows dominant local SRH (OBSERVED; device IQE UNRESOLVED)

- Worker 이택규 provided three SVisual Probe screenshots on the completed `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/n2_des` final TDR. All three are the **same point**: zone `Clean_QW4(InGaN)`, x=`0.244864017914`, y=`0.651958341615`, z=0. This differs from earlier SRH y=0.599783903626 and initial Rrad y=0.58321731303; do not mix old and new point values.
- Same-point fields in cm^-3 s^-1 (screen values): `RadiativeRecombination=7.103015017104e18`; `srhRecombination=1.681575471039e22`; `AugerRecombination=1.238545872618e15`; `TotalRecombination=1.682285896396e22`. Sum agrees with displayed TotalRecombination within screenshot precision.
- Derived **LOCAL radiative fraction only**: `100*Rrad/(Rrad+Rsrh+RAuger)≈0.0422%`; local nonradiative fraction ≈99.9578%; SRH dominates at this sampled point. This is **NOT** full-QW or full-device IQE, nor proof of overall LED performance/failure. QW1–QW3 require corresponding SRH/Auger samples and integrated full-QW volumes for recombination-based IQE.
- Importantly `NtSide=0` disables parameterized damaged-edge traps in this reference branch but does NOT disable the generic `SRH()` bulk nonradiative recombination physics; high QW local SRH does not by itself prove sidewall damage or carbon-project effect. Need inspect active carrier lifetime, material parameters and field/region distribution before root-cause claims.
- NEXT: preserve outputs and avoid rerun; use read-only SVisual integrated QW Rrad/SRH/Auger workflow and compare QW1–4, inspect actual active SRH lifetime and material database, 2D current normalization/physical injection. Use same-bias/current full vs half/fine check before declaring Common Baseline. No TCAD code modified.

## 2026-10-09 — Corrected measurement priority: QW3 probes confirmed, per-region integration needed (OBSERVED / SCIENTIFIC DECISION)

- Worker: 이택규. User submitted SVisual Probe screenshots in the successful `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/n2_des` 5V result. Clean_QW3(InGaN) same location x=0.219173763524, y=0.555622585194, z=0: `RadiativeRecombination=8.333611568957e14`, `srhRecombination=5.390114530106e19`, `AugerRecombination=5.79338765299e8` cm^-3 s^-1. Other captured fields include electron density 1.385821616728e14 and hole density 4.507709343047e11 (units of densities expected cm^-3, panel exact unit not shown). Numerical point checks are local only, no physical IQE claim.
- User correctly identified that publication analysis requires **integrating the recombination rate over each entire QW**, not further collecting isolated probes. Adopt `CMP/PROJECT_AB_PRE_RUN_AUDIT.md` G5 and metric definition: integrate Rrad, SRH, Auger over each QW region, sum integrals, THEN compute recombination-based IQE. Do not average or sum local fractional IQEs. The local QW3 and QW4 probes suggest large SRH at those sampled points but are not representative of whole-well rates.
- First non-destructive operational check: SVisual Tools > Integrate (∫dr right toolbar), field RadiativeRecombination, Region/Material filter Clean_QW3 only, complete spatial domain and Start Integration. Save/report raw integral AND domain units displayed; then integrate same QW's srhRecombination and AugerRecombination and expand QW1..4. Include DmgL_QW regions as appropriate for complete active-QW physical volume and matched full/half comparisons, explicitly avoid counting Clean-only as total QW losses. Two-dimensional SVisual integration produces an area integral with native geometrical units; out-of-plane depth/2D normalization and actual physical cm unit conversion MUST be verified for absolute recombination counts; a ratio of comparably normalized integrals cancels common factors.
- Older and newer Sentaurus Visual User Guides document Field Integration GUI and `integrate_field -field ... -regions {Clean_QW3}`; current environment T-2022.03-specific GUI behavior and output units still require a user screenshot before scripting/automation is treated as validated. No TCAD source or baseline changes or new solver runs.

## 2026-10-09 — 5V SVisual Clean_QW3 Rad field integral and '+' label correction (OBSERVED / UNRESOLVED)

- Worker 이택규 supplied `Field Integration` screenshot for `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/n2_des`: field `RadiativeRecombination`, right pane `Regions of Dimension 2` shows ONLY `Clean_QW3 (InGaN)` with `Integral = 2.657110e+02 [s^-1*um^-1]`, `Domain=5.985012e-03 [um^2]`. This is **Clean_QW3-only 2D area integral**, not full QW3 or total photon output, and NOT IQE. Left list highlights both `Clean_QW3` and `Clean_QW3+DmgL_QW3` but only Clean_QW3 appears in right output, possibly stale result until Start Integration; do not interpret highlighted items as proven integrated.
- **Correction of previous GPT claim:** `Clean_QW3+DmgL_QW3` should NOT be assumed to denote union of bulk regions or selected as sole full-well ROI. Its structure and lack of inclusion in the dimension-2 output indicate it is likely a lower-dimensional boundary/interface label. Exact T-2022.03 metadata for '+' label has not been independently inspected, so interface interpretation remains PROVISIONAL. Safest method: select standalone region `DmgL_QW3` (not '+' named item), click `Start Integration`, verify `Regions of Dimension 2: DmgL_QW3`, record its Integral/Domain, then **sum independent Clean_QW3 and DmgL_QW3** integrals for whole QW3 (or choose both standalone 2D regions and verify both appear in output). Do not double-count interface or mix old results.
- The physical measured rate is 2D area-integrated per out-of-plane unit; raw SVisual [s^-1 um^-1] is NOT absolute 3D photon rate without explicit effective thickness. Same geometric normalization cancels for recombination fraction ratios when all wells are treated consistently; continue SRH/Auger over same 2D set and four QWs before IQE.
- Source: user screenshot Oct9 and earlier GitHub `PROJECT_AB_PRE_RUN_AUDIT.md`, SVisual manual Integration Tool general region-filter procedure. No code or TCAD source modified, no new run.

## 2026-10-09 — QW3 full 2D Radiative integration obtained from separate Clean/Dmg regions (OBSERVED)

- Worker 이택규; user SVisual Field Integration screenshot of completed `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/n2_des`, field `RadiativeRecombination`, `Regions of Dimension 2` explicitly lists **DmgL_QW3 (InGaN)**: `Integral=5.268180e-01 [s^-1*um^-1]`, `Domain=1.500002e-05 [um^2]`.
- Previously directly observed **Clean_QW3 (InGaN)**: `Integral=2.657110e+02 [s^-1*um^-1]`, `Domain=5.985012e-03 [um^2]`.
- These are separate disjoint **2D area region** integrals, so the full QW3 half-device measured raw regional sum = **266.237818 s^-1 um^-1**; total measured 2D domain area = **0.00600001202 um^2**. Arithmetic: 265.711 + 0.526818; 0.005985012 + 0.00001500002. **Derived**, not direct SVisual combined group output.
- This supersedes earlier incorrect idea that '+' item is a merged area. The `Clean_QW3+DmgL_QW3` entry should not be used as integrated 2D union without proof (likely lower-dimensional interface). Not full device IQE/absolute 3D photon rate. At NtSide=0, parametric damaged-edge traps are off, while DmgL_QW3 geometry exists.
- NEXT READ-ONLY: Integrate `srhRecombination` for standalone Clean_QW3 and DmgL_QW3 (or both as explicitly distinct 2D regions with actual Total Integral verification), then `AugerRecombination` same region scope. Keep units and voltage fixed; after all four QWs, compute recombination-based IQE from summed Rrad/SRH/Auger integrals; confirm normalization, full-vs-half equivalence and current physics before declaring baseline.
- No TCAD source edit, no new run; original files and checkpoints retained.

## 2026-10-09 — 5V half TEST DmgL_QW3 spatial SRH integral measured (OBSERVED)

- Worker 이택규 sent direct Sentaurus Visual Field Integration screenshot, Dataset=n2_des, field=srhRecombination, Regions of Dimension 2: **DmgL_QW3 (InGaN)**. Integral `1.655249e+03 [s^-1*um^-1]`, Domain `1.500002e-05 [um^2]`, Total Integral same. This is a verified **2D area-region** integral (per out-of-plane um), not a local Probe point and not combined whole-QW SRH.
- Prior independent DmgL_QW3 Radiative 2D area integral `5.268180e-01 [s^-1*um^-1]` on same region and domain. Observed DmgL segment SRH substantially exceeds Radiative; Auger integral for that area still unknown, so no exact regional radiative share or IQE claim. NtSide=0 does not eliminate generic SRH() bulk recombination; causal attribution to sidewall trap or Project A carbon NOT supported.
- Other prior independent 2D area result Clean_QW3 Radiative 265.711 [s^-1*um^-1]. Current full QW3 total Radiative Clean + DmgL = 266.237818 [s^-1*um^-1]. **Clean_QW3 SRH integral still missing**, so no total QW3 SRH or IQE.
- NEXT read-only GUI: choose `srhRecombination`, select **standalone `Clean_QW3`** (not plus-named 1D interface), press Start Integration and capture result and Domain. Then integrate AugerRecombination over both standalone Clean_QW3 and DmgL_QW3. Verify corresponding area and results before summing for QW3 radiative-recombination ratio. Preserve saved 5V_TEST outputs, no solver/code changes.

## 2026-10-09 — QW3 DmgL Auger spatial integral measured (OBSERVED)

- 이택규 supplied direct SVisual Field Integration screenshot for completed `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/n2_des`: `AugerRecombination` `Regions of Dimension 2: DmgL_QW3 (InGaN)`; `Integral=5.774334e-02 [s^-1*um^-1]`, `Domain=1.500002e-05 [um^2]`.
- Prior directly observed same-region 2D Radiative `0.526818`, SRH `1655.249` [s^-1 um^-1] and same Domain. Therefore DmgL_QW3 has all 3 regional integrals and SRH dominates *this segment*. At `NtSide=0`, generic SRH remains active; do NOT attribute to parameterized edge traps or infer full QW/device IQE.
- The earlier request was `Clean_QW3` SRH; user instead measured DmgL_QW3 Auger, which is useful and preserved. Still missing standalone `Clean_QW3` SRH and Auger for full QW3 radiative-vs-nonradiative integration. Clean_QW3 Radiative=265.711 [s^-1 um^-1]. NEXT: switch field `srhRecombination` + select only standalone `Clean_QW3` + Start Integration, screenshot. Then `AugerRecombination` + standalone `Clean_QW3`, repeat. No code edits or rerun.

## 2026-10-09 — QW3 whole-well 2D recombination integrals and derived recombination fraction (OBSERVED + DERIVED)

- Worker: 이택규. User screenshots of Sentaurus Visual Field Integration from successful 5V `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/n2_des`. Newly OBSERVED `Clean_QW3(InGaN)`, Region of Dimension 2: `srhRecombination Integral=5.841611e+05 [s^-1 um^-1]` and `AugerRecombination Integral=1.265704e+01 [s^-1 um^-1]`; both Domain `5.985012e-03 um^2`. Earlier standalone Clean_QW3 Rrad=265.711; DmgL_QW3 Rrad=0.526818, SRH=1655.249, Auger=0.05774334 [s^-1 um^-1], Dmg Domain=1.500002e-05 um^2.
- Independent nonoverlapping **Half-domain QW3 Clean+DmgL** 2D area integral sums [s^-1 um^-1]: Rrad=**266.237818**; SRH=**585816.349**; Auger=**12.71478334**; sum all 3=**586095.30160134**. Derived recombination-based **QW3-only, 5V, NtSide=0 ratio** = 100*266.237818/586095.30160134 = **0.0454256871%**. SRH fraction ≈99.9524049%, Auger fraction≈0.0021694054%.
- Fraction of QW3 SRH integral from Clean region = 584161.1/585816.349 ≈99.71745%; DmgL contribution ~0.28255%. This matters for Project A sidewall-loss hypothesis: high QW3 SRH is not dominated by Dmg region under NtSide=0 in this output. It does NOT diagnose causes; Clean area is also ~99.75% of total QW3 physical cross-section. Generic SRH remains active even when NtSide=0. Need verify effective SRH lifetimes, material radiative coefficients, carrier density, local recombination maps and current normalization before claiming physical LED model is valid.
- **Strict scope**: QW3 recombination-ratio from spatial integrals, NOT whole-MQW/device IQE, EQE, measured experimental light, or proof that damaged NtSide=1e18 device behaves similarly. 2D integrals are per out-of-plane micrometer per SVisual display, common thickness factors cancel in within-device ratios. Full/fine vs Half/coarse and mesh convergence still unverified.
- NEXT: integrate Rrad/SRH/Auger in standalone Clean_QW1 + DmgL_QW1, QW2, QW4; record Region Dimension 2/Domain and compute 4-QW summed IQE. In parallel physical parameter and J-normalization audit; no modifications/re-run now.

## 2026-10-09 — Physical plausibility review after very low QW3 radiative share (OBSERVED vs HYPOTHESES)

- Worker: 이택규 asks whether real LED IQE is similarly low, whether device is incorrectly configured, and whether recombination can occur at QW/barrier interfaces or mesa edge instead of QW interiors. This is an interpretation/audit response, **not a new TCAD measurement**.
- Actual 5V_TEST `NtSide=0` Half/Coarse **QW3 only** Clean+DmgL spatially integrated Rrad=266.237818, SRH=585816.349, Auger=12.71478334 s^-1 um^-1, recombination radiative ratio 0.0454256871%. Device-wide IQE and electrical injection efficiency NOT verified. Rad >0 in all four QWs locally, so physically modeled radiative recombination occurs in InGaN wells; NOT equivalent to confirmed practical LED electroluminescence.
- Of QW3 SRH, 584161.1/585816.349≈99.717% integrated over **Clean_QW3** versus DmgL_QW3≈0.283%. Crucial area context: Clean area 0.005985012/0.00600001202≈99.75%, Dmg≈0.25%; cannot infer defects strongly favor clean core or sidewall merely from integrated shares. NtSide=0 means parametric Dmg trap off, but global SRH() remains active.
- Earlier co-located QW3 Probe x=0.219173763524 y=0.555622585194 has electron density 1.385821616728e14, hole density 4.507709343047e11 cm^-3 (from user panel), a strong local n/p imbalance (single-point only); one working mechanism to investigate is weak hole injection and/or QW polarization overlap. Others: very small 5V terminal current raw 1.44801646079583e-11 with 2D unit/AreaFactor unverified, excessive effective SRH rates / lifetimes, insufficient radiative coefficient/overlap, transient vs quasistationary solver output and mesh sensitivity. Hypotheses only; no cause established.
- Actual user-supplied `pp2_des.cmd` declares `SRH()`, `Auger()`, `Radiative`, and output recombination fields. `FASTC1_pp6_des.par` showed only lattice/Thermionic/Mg active ionization and no explicit Rrad coefficient/lifetime; active SDevice material database or effective parameter paths not checked. Legacy GitHub `CMP/tcad/CURRENT/sdevice2_defect_on.cmd` is NOT source of truth for live 5V_TEST pp2 (avoid confusing).
- Physics: desirable radiative e/h recombination inside InGaN QWs; QW/barrier boundary can exhibit radiative or non-radiative recombination, but interfacial SRH requires corresponding interface traps / relevant bulk SRH near boundary; screenshots cannot attribute to interfaces. DmgL_QW3 is the existing etched mesa-sidewall strip and only one area. Published low-current density InGaN microLED study (PMCID PMC8175512) explains SRH can dominate at low injection; published Nature Communications 2023 10×10 um2 blue microLED reports EQE 3.0% at J=0.1 A/cm2 (DOI 10.1038/s41467-023-36773-w) and IEEE TED 2024 reports passivated device EQE≈25% (DOI 10.1109/TED.2024.3449829). Comparisons are EQE vs *only QW3 recombination fraction*, not apples-to-apples benchmarks.
- DECISION / PRIORITY: Do not freeze baseline, alter SRH lifetimes, or conclude failure solely from 0.0454%; FIRST inspect active pp2 physics, actual InGaN effective radiative/SRH material parameters, 2D current normalization & J(V), QW carrier distribution, and 5V final-state quasi-static consistency. Continue four-QW integrals for true recombination-based IQE, then matched-current NtSide1e18 damaged and Full/fine mesh comparisons; Project A/B production still NO-GO.

## 2026-10-09 — QW4 full Half 2D recombination integrals, Clean+DmgL (OBSERVED + DERIVED)

- Worker 이택규 submitted SVisual Field Integration screenshots from completed `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/n2_des` 5V, NtSide=0. 2D `Clean_QW4(InGaN)` (domain 5.985012e-03 um²), values s^-1 um^-1: Radiative=3.874696e+04 (=38746.96), srh=3.561769e+07 (=35617690), Auger=1.327983e+03 (=1327.983).
- Same field, separately integrated 2D `DmgL_QW4(InGaN)` (domain 1.500002e-05 um²): Radiative=9.876800e+01 (=98.768), srh=2.264962e+05 (=226496.2), Auger=2.414354e+00 (=2.414354). Repeated DmgL Rad screenshot is duplicate, not independent new sample.
- **Derived QW4 complete Half Clean+DmgL integral sums** [s^-1 um^-1]: Rrad=**38845.728**, SRH=**35844186.2**, Auger=**1330.397354**, sum=**35884362.325354**. Recombination-based QW4-only ratio `100*38845.728/35884362.325354=0.1082525242%`. SRH fraction = 99.8880400%; Auger=0.00370746%. Comparatively prior QW3-only same type ratio 0.0454256871%; QW4 is ~2.383 times QW3's ratio, yet SRH dominates both.
- Of QW4 integrated SRH, clean 35617690/35844186.2≈99.3681%, but clean area is ~99.75% of total area; area ratio matters and no defect or sidewall cause can be inferred solely from total shares. All values are modeled 2D normalized integrals at 5V and NtSide0. QW4 ratio is **NOT** the 4-QW/device IQE, EQE, or experimental device efficiency. Physical validity still needs carrier injection, 2D current normalizations, effective radiative/SRH material parameters and mesh/reference comparison.
- NEXT: independently integrate Radiative, SRH, Auger in standalone 2D `Clean_QW1` / `DmgL_QW1` and `Clean_QW2` / `DmgL_QW2` and combine four-QW totals. No source changes, solver rerun, or cleanup. Continue physics audit (live pp2 and material database) before declaring baseline valid.

## 2026-10-09 — QW2 complete 2D Clean/DmgL radiative, SRH, Auger integrals + active physics grep (OBSERVED / DERIVED)

- Worker 이택규 shared six Sentaurus Visual T-2022.03 Field Integration screenshots from the completed `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/n2_des` dataset at 5V, NtSide=0, Half+Coarse. Right pane confirms Regions of Dimension 2 for every selected independent region/field, and common per-region 2D Domains. Units for rate area-integrals [s^-1 um^-1].
- **Clean_QW2(InGaN)** (Domain=5.984982e-03 um²): Radiative=8.331490e+01 (=83.3149), srh=5.464576e+04 (=54645.76), Auger=1.736316e+00 (=1.736316).
- **DmgL_QW2(InGaN)** (Domain=1.499994e-05 um²): Radiative=1.672872e-01 (=0.1672872), srh=1.416049e+02 (=141.6049), Auger=3.800247e-03 (=0.003800247).
- Derived nonoverlapping **full QW2 Half-domain** sums: Rrad=**83.4821872**; SRH=**54787.3649**; Auger=**1.740116247**; All=**54872.587203447** [s^-1 um^-1], Total Area=0.00599998194 um². Derived `IQE_rec,QW2=100*Rrad/(Rrad+SRH+Auger)=0.1521382378%`; SRH share=99.8446906%, Auger share=0.00317119%. IMPORTANT: **QW2-only**, not device IQE/EQE; QW1 pending and physics unvalidated. Comparators QW3=0.0454256871%, QW4=0.1082525242%, all QW-only.
- Same user terminal ran read-only `grep -niE 'Lifetime|Tau|Radiative|SRH|Auger|DefaultParametersFromFile|AreaFactor' pp2_des.cmd FASTC1_pp6_des.par | head -n 90`: `pp2_des.cmd:68 DefaultParametersFromFile`, lines 80/82/84 `SRH()`, `Auger()`, `Radiative`; lines 398–406 desired output fields; NO explicit lifetime/Tau/Radiative coefficient/AreaFactor matched in these two files. This proves model declarations and default-parameter flag but **NOT** the numerical effective lifetime/radiative coefficients; material DB and log remain to be checked. No right to conclude unphysical defaults or that Radiative coefficient is zero without material model verification.
- Next: run QW1 six standalone 2D region integrations (Clean_QW1 and DmgL_QW1, each Radiative/srh/Auger); sum four QW integrals to compute recombination-based full MQW fraction. In parallel inspect actual effective SDevice material SRH/radiative coefficients and 2D terminal J/AreaFactor; do not modify source or rerun, Common Baseline still not frozen, A/B NO-GO.

## 2026-10-09 — Four MQW 5V half-device area-integrated recombination ratios completed (OBSERVED + DERIVED)

- Worker: 이택규. Six direct SVisual `n2_des` Field Integration screenshots completed Clean_QW1 and DmgL_QW1 2D regions at 5V on `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST` NtSide=0 Half+Coarse. Clean_QW1, domain=5.985012e-3 um²: Radiative=8.579041e2, srh=7.765839e4, Auger=2.525448e2 [s^-1 um^-1]. DmgL_QW1, domain=1.500002e-5 um²: Radiative=1.946374e1, srh=4.966036e2, Auger=2.309115e0 [s^-1 um^-1]. All six corresponding fields and 2D region names verified from screenshots.
- Derived QW1 complete Half-domain Clean+DmgL: Rrad=877.36784; SRH=78154.9936; Auger=254.853915; Total=79287.215355 [s^-1 um^-1], recombination-based well radiative fraction 1.1065691185%.
- Prior QW2 totals: Rrad 83.4821872, SRH 54787.3649, Auger 1.740116247, well fraction 0.1521382378%; QW3 totals Rrad 266.237818, SRH 585816.349, Auger 12.71478334, well fraction 0.0454256871%; QW4 totals Rrad 38845.728, SRH 35844186.2, Auger 1330.397354, well fraction 0.1082525242%. All original user SVisual screenshots already separately logged.
- **NEW derived four-QW total** (independent Clean and DmgL 2D area integral sums in same units s^-1 um^-1): Rrad=40072.8158452; SRH=36562944.9075; Auger=1599.706168587; total three-rate recombination=36604617.4295138. **MQW recombination-based radiative share = 100*Rrad/Total=0.1094747566%**; SRH share=99.8861550%; Auger share=0.00437023%. QW4 contributed 96.9378547% of measured integrated MQW Rrad. The single-well 1.10657% QW1 ratio must NOT be averaged with other well ratios to get this total.
- **Scope/limitations**: This is only the 4-InGaN-QW recombination-based ratio at one simulated 5V step in the Half+Coarse NtSide=0 2D deck; it is NOT experimental LED IQE/EQE nor complete optical output, injection efficiency, or proof of sound reference physics. SVisual reports 2D integration [s^-1 um^-1], so true absolute total requires depth/current-area normalization. Presence of `DefaultParametersFromFile`, `SRH()`, `Auger()`, `Radiative` in pp2 does NOT establish numerical lifetimes or radiative coefficients. Existing reported endpoint current 1.44801646079583e-11 in n2_des.plt requires dimension/unit validation. High SRH under NtSide=0 and QW4 dominance require material model, hole injection/polarization, steady-state and current normalization audit BEFORE baseline freeze or A/B operation. No 5V data or source modified, no rerun.

## 2026-10-09 — Paper provenance cross-check and MaterialDB load log (OBSERVED / QUALIFIED)

- 이택규 asked whether dimensions and QW stack are all paper-based and supplied fresh read-only `grep -niE 'Radiative|SRH|Auger|Lifetime|Tau|material|parameter|AreaFactor' n2_des.log | head -n 100` for `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`.
- Repository `CMP/COMMON_BASELINE.md` documents a **literature-based representative hybrid TCAD model, not JBD exact pixel/mesa replica**. Documented nominal full geometry: 2D Cartesian planar, mesa width 4.0 um **modeling choice**, computational domain 5 um, numerically defined 0.3um n-base and 0.1um nitride, each sidewall Dmg width 5nm modeled from Wu; n-GaN 4um, p-GaN 120nm, p-Al0.15Ga0.85N EBL 26nm, four In0.15Ga0.85N QWs each 3nm and five GaN barriers each 22nm from Kou 2019. It does **not** claim all settings direct from same publication. The current 5V_TEST Half+Coarse geometry/source was NOT freshly inspected here; do not equate stated nominal to exact current coordinate boundaries without comparing live pp1_dvs.cmd or n1_msh.tdr.
- Primary sources externally confirmed: Kou et al., `Impact of the surface recombination on InGaN/GaN-based blue micro-light emitting diodes`, Optics Express 2019 DOI 10.1364/OE.27.00A643 documents ~445nm emission, four-period In0.15Ga0.85N/GaN with QW 3nm/barrier 22nm, 4um nGaN, 26nm p-Al0.15 EBL, 120nm pGaN; full original paper also includes a 20nm highly doped pGaN contact cap beyond documented baseline vertical stack—verify if full deck implements this before saying exact Kou copy. Wu et al. `Physical mechanisms on the size-effect in GaN-based Micro-LEDs`, Micro and Nanostructures 2023 DOI 10.1016/j.micrna.2023.207542 sets acceptor-like sidewall traps in 5nm damaged strip; Wu's own epitaxy differs (In fraction 0.08, barrier 8nm, nGaN 3.9um), so our baseline intentionally does NOT mix that epi. Chen et al. 2024 DOI 10.1021/acsaelm.4c01540 has an experimental 4x4um mesa, supporting size relevance, but does not establish that JBD's mesa is 4um. JBD official 0.13inch 640x480 documentation explicitly has pixel pitch 4um, **not mesa width** (https://www.jb-display.com/product_des/3.html).
- User `n2_des.log` grep actually showed 338 With SRH-Recombination, 345 With Auger, 346 With Radiative and 417 With default parameters from file; `DefaultParametersFromFile: material GaN: .../MaterialDB/GaN.par` around 804 and `InGaN: .../MaterialDB/InGaN.par` around 951 (also Silicon, InN). Thus material files **were opened/parsed**. No effective numeric SRH lifetime or Radiative/Auger coefficients were established by this grep. `Use Si parameters` at log ~336 requires context; cannot conclude InGaN uses Si because the log separately reads GaN/InGaN material DB. Potential library parameter fallback/interpolation needs direct material file and log context inspection.
- Important physical caveat: numerical trap NtSide=1e18, Et=Ev+0.75 eV and capture sigma 1e-15 cm² were calibration/modeling assumptions in COMMON_BASELINE, NOT direct measured JBD or Wu parameters. Same goes for p active concentration ~3e17 approximations and barrier background doping. 5V Half/Coarse model's MQW integrated recombination radiative share ~0.10947% is observed/derived but low; geometry being literature-motivated does NOT validate material coefficients, current injection, or IQE.
- NEXT read-only terminal gate: inspect `sed -n '264,355p' n2_des.log` around default/Use Si context; read exact material database `InGaN.par`, `GaN.par`, `InN.par` SRH/Radiative/Auger sections and *effective parameter interpolation* or material overrides; inspect live `pp1_dvs.cmd` SDE geometry against literature documented nominal; leave solver/source and baseline unchanged.

## 2026-10-09 — MaterialDB inspection shell mismatch; corrected read-only action

- 이택규 observed `n2_des.log` physical model block around lines 330–350: SRH/Auger/Radiative active; SRH has no field/doping/temperature lifetime dependence, Surface-Recombination off; line `Use Si parameters` has **unresolved** material/device-scope meaning.
- Assistant provided Bash `DB=...` and `for ...; do` but user terminal is C-shell family (likely csh/tcsh); all those MaterialDB grep attempts failed with Command not found/Undefined variable, no parameter numbers obtained. This is a command-syntax guidance error, not Sentaurus failure; no files changed.
- NEXT: run `grep -niE 'SRH|Radiative|Auger|taun0|taup0|Scharfetter' /user/tools/synopsys/sentaurus/T-2022.03/tcad/current/lib/sdevice/MaterialDB/InGaN.par | head -n 70`; review actual values/sections and context, compare GaN/InN only as necessary; do not modify model until effective parameter check.

## 2026-10-09 — Read-only InGaN.par recombination section located (OBSERVED, values not yet inspected)

- Worker 이택규 ran csh/tcsh-compatible command in the 5V_TEST directory:
  `grep -niE 'SRH|Radiative|Auger|taun0|taup0|Scharfetter' /user/tools/synopsys/sentaurus/T-2022.03/tcad/current/lib/sdevice/MaterialDB/InGaN.par | head -n 70`
- Actual output:
  `870:Scharfetter * relation and trap level for SRH recombination:`
  `883:Auger * coefficients:`
  `884:{ * R_Auger = ( C_n n + C_p p ) ( n p - ni_eff^2)`
  `893:RadiativeRecombination * coefficients:`
  `894:{ * R_Radiative = C (n p - ni_eff^2)`
- This confirms only the **section/comment locations** in InGaN.par, **not** any numerical SRH lifetimes or Auger/Radiative coefficients. No effective QW parameter values or physical cause of low MQW radiative ratio established. Avoid claiming that parameters are absent, zero or correct merely from these comment matches.
- NEXT READ-ONLY csh/tcsh-compatible command: `sed -n '855,925p' /user/tools/synopsys/sentaurus/T-2022.03/tcad/current/lib/sdevice/MaterialDB/InGaN.par`. Inspect comments, actual material coefficients, and presence of interpolation or inherited defaults. If material file is only a ternary placeholder, inspect InN.par and GaN.par plus effective SDevice log; compare bias/carrier injection before any correction. No code changes or rerun.

## 2026-10-09 — CRITICAL OBSERVED InGaN MaterialDB warning: GaAs-derived recombination parameters require calibration

- 작업자 이택규 provided direct terminal `sed -n '855,925p' /user/tools/synopsys/sentaurus/T-2022.03/tcad/current/lib/sdevice/MaterialDB/InGaN.par` for actual Sentaurus T-2022.03 environment. **Direct vendor material file warning** immediately before Scharfetter SRH / Auger / Radiative sections: `Parameters for the recombination models below were taken from GaAs and require calibration for accurate simulations`.
- The InGaN.par values documented in actual file: `Scharfetter taumin=0,0 [s]`; `taumax=1.0e-9,1.0e-9 [s]`; `Nref=1.0e16,1.0e16 cm^-3`; `gamma=1,1`; `Talpha=Tcoeff=0`; `Etrap=0`. `Auger A=1.0e-30,1.0e-30 cm^6/s`, `B=C=H=0`; `RadiativeRecombination C=2.0e-10 cm^3/s`. The radiative coefficient symbol in par is C (commonly referred to as B in LED ABC notation).
- This is ACTUAL MATERIAL FILE evidence, **not yet complete proof of effective per-In0.15Ga0.85N parameters at the active QWs** (material mixing/overrides and file-precedence audit pending). `n2_des.log` previously observed `DefaultParametersFromFile` for InGaN.par, and SRH/Rad/Auger enabled, without field/doping/temperature-dependent lifetimes. Never automatically infer effective SRH lifetime everywhere equals 1ns without inspecting enabled model and resolved coefficients.
- SCIENTIFIC STATUS: Existing 5V Half+Coarse NtSide=0 recombination-only 4-QW ratio=0.1094747566% with SRH 99.886155%. The GaAs-derived uncalibrated InGaN recombination parameters make physical validity an **explicit calibration blocker**, not proof of a geometrically incorrect Mesa/MQW or sole proven cause of low efficiency. NtSide=0 removes parameterized edge traps, but global SRH() persists. Deep-electrical injection/J normalization, polarization, band profiles, material mixing may also matter.
- DECISION / NEXT: preserve baseline and measured simulation outputs (do not silently tune lifetime to increase efficiency); first verify active log/model parameter precedence `sed -n '945,970p' n2_des.log` and `sed -n '270,310p' n2_des.log`, determine proper In0.15Ga0.85N interpolated/overridden Rrad/SRH/Auger coefficients, verify 2D current injection. Then establish literature-backed parameter calibration and sensitivity with unchanged geometry and documented alternate physics branch only after team approval. No TCAD source edited or rerun in this check.

## 2026-10-09 — Literature cross-check & Baseline rerun GO/NO-GO after 5V_TEST low MQW efficiency (REVIEWED, not new simulation)

- Worker 이택규 supplied actual n2_des.log sections. Observed DefaultParametersFromFile loads T-2022.03 MaterialDB/InGaN.par and InN.par, and ModelParameters FASTC1_pp6_des.par, Grid n1_msh.tdr, Current n2_des.plt; log says no separate Lifetime file. This does NOT mean SRH is off or there is no lifetime: active MaterialDB Scharfetter section provides it. The global default block 'Use Si parameters' / 'Without incomplete ionization' cannot be assigned to active InGaN wells or Mg settings without region context. No override coefficients or final mole-fraction interpolation verified yet.
- **Peer-reviewed basis**: Kou et al. Optics Express 2019 DOI 10.1364/OE.27.00A643 uses Auger 1e-30 cm6/s, SRH numerical lifetime 1e-7 (paper displays unit s^-1, which is inconsistent with lifetime and must be flagged as a likely notation error, not ignored); Baek et al. Nature Communications 2023 DOI 10.1038/s41467-023-36773-w simulation uses SRH 100ns, Radiative 1e-10 cm3/s, Auger 1e-31 cm6/s, with a DIFFERENT 6-QW epitaxy and fitted polarization/interface assumptions. Low-current SRH dominance also discussed in Nanoscale Research Letters 2021 https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8175512/. None uniquely fixes our model values without calibration.
- **Existing vendor file**: InGaN.par explicitly warns GaAs-derived SRH/Auger/Radiative parameters require calibration; Scharfetter taumax 1e-9 s; Rrad C=2e-10; Auger A=1e-30. File values are not yet proven to be final effective xIn=0.15 parameters. Relative to published 100ns example the file taumax is 100 times shorter, potentially explaining large SRH but not a proved sole root cause.
- Existing 5V NtSide0 Half+Coarse integrated 4 QWs Clean+DmgL: Rrad 40072.8158452, SRH 36562944.9075, Auger 1599.706168587 [s^-1 um^-1], fraction 0.1094747566%. Source no user code changes. QW4 ~96.94% of Rrad integral. 2D PLT terminal current raw =1.44801646079583e-11, dimension and AreaFactor still unresolved. From 2D QW3 area 0.00600001202um2 and QW thickness 0.003um, inferred Half width approximately 2um: **CONDITIONAL** on no scaling and A/um terminal current, J_5V ≈ 1.448e-11 / 2 × 1e8 ≈ 7.24e-4 A/cm2, much less than literature 0.1 A/cm2 low-current example; this is NOT verified operating J.
- **Verdict**: No evidence the nominal four-QW Kou-based geometry itself must be rebuilt; no validation of a publishable absolute IQE/optical LED baseline. Need to resolve active material parameters, low current density, carrier injection/polarization, steady-state validity and Half-vs-Full reference. Current IQE issue **must be addressed or clearly bounded** before using baseline for credible Project A/B SRH/IQE improvement conclusions. Causality not established. No new long run now; original finished files protected.
- **Stage plan** (proposal only): (1) read-only pp2/log/material model precedence and QW In mole interpolation, 2D J and equivalent 2D Half area, carrier/hole density and interface traps; (2) literature-supported calibrated parameter *separate branch* including tau sensitivity 1ns/10ns/100ns as exploratory, not automatic performance tuning; compare at same J and keep nominal sidewall Trap; (3) Short NtSide0 QS/steady + checkpoint pilot, electrical/optical checks; (4) NtSide1e18 matched-current sidewall contrast; (5) Mesh convergence and Full-vs-Half, 4/10/20um and Nt sensitivity for paper; (6) only then freeze revised physical Baseline, Project A/B null-control/pilot and broader DOE. Must not silently alter original source.

## 2026-10-09 — Live 5V_TEST pp2 model audit evidence (이택규)

- OBSERVED actual pp2 shows Fermi, Thermionic, piezo polarization, default material files, SRH/Auger/Radiative. Region `IncompleteIonization` at lines 128/137; `Traps` region declarations 141–361; `Transient=BE` at 515, `Transient(` at 585. No AreaFactor/Quasistationary in pp2/par grep.
- Region-specific Mg incomplete ionization and actual Trap concentrations are UNVERIFIED until Physics-region blocks inspected; appearance of `Traps` does not contradict NtSide0 by itself. 5V normal finish is transient, not proven steady state. Need effective InGaN material parameters and verified J normalization before IQE publication claim.
- NEXT read-only `sed -n '112,175p' pp2_des.cmd` and `sed -n '505,615p' pp2_des.cmd`; do not modify original solver/results.

## 2026-10-09 — SWB Create Parameter File dialog and silicon-vs-GaN misconception; controlled baseline calibration plan (OBSERVED + REVIEWED)

- Worker 이택규 screenshot: SWB title shows **/user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB** (the *original branch*, NOT already-completed `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`). Dialog `Create Parameter File`: **`Parameter file sdevice.par does not exist`**, radio choices `Silicon` default selected, `Choose Materials`, `Create Empty File`; scenario `NtSide=0`, SDE→SDEVICE.
- This is an **input-generation dialog** not an SDevice error or proof the existing 5V simulation used Silicon physics. Actual completed 5V_TEST n2_des.log lists `ModelParameters file: FASTC1_pp6_des.par`, `DefaultParametersFromFile` loading GaN/InGaN/InN MaterialDB, and a working 5V curve trace; that branch's `pp2_des.cmd` has region-specific incomplete ionization and `NtSide=0` ALL 12 sidewall `Conc=0` entries preprocessed (already earlier recorded in LIVE_STATE JSON). Do not confuse same old SWB input-file workflow with 5V_TEST source.
- Synopsys SWB User Guide (publicly accessible N-2017.09 pages 65–68, https://studylib.net/doc/28266667/swb-ug) documents `Tool > Edit Input > Parameter` then `Choose Materials` and selection, copies chosen release MaterialDB files into project and includes `Material="GaN" { #includeext ... }` etc in sdevice.par; Silicon default merely generates Silicon material file; `Create Empty File` possible. Tool properties can use common `sdevice.par` or per-tool .par. Sentaurus Device default physical parameters have builtin/material DB/custom parameter file precedence; blindly generating/using a new sdevice.par can overwrite working FASTC1_pp6_des.par customization (e.g., lattice/polarization/thermionic and Magnesium ionization), and merely copying the uncalibrated GaAs-derived InGaN.par does NOT improve recombination IQE.
- Intended mesh materials in Common Baseline: GaN, InGaN, AlGaN, Nitride (Si3N4); InN relevant as InGaN constituent and file-loader but not necessarily an explicitly meshed domain. Confirm exact mesh material names before choosing in a NEW clone. Danger: picking only GaN does not set all InGaN/AlGaN regions to GaN; material assignment is in SDE/TDR.
- **Immediate safe recommendation**: Cancel current parameter creation in original JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB, do NOT hit OK with Silicon or generate any .par there, do NOT rerun there yet. Clone known 5V_TEST to separate calibration sandbox after backing up existing source and results, audit `File{Parameters}` of active sdevice source and actual pp2_des.par/FASTC1_pp6_des.par before integrating a region/material-specific calibration par.
- As of 2026-10-08 JuSubin timeline (documented, not necessarily new actions today): Half+coarse mesh 138,194 elements/65,513 points versus Full 290,814; half+coarse equivalence to Full unverified; Mg/n-GaN doping-profile physical validation not complete; QS 0.3V pilot proposed; later LeeTaekGyu Oct9 run of QS Copy failed at **0.019304636 V** with Newton 15 iterations then MinStep; physical cause unresolved. Additional sidewall trap-ON NtSide=1e18 in accelerated Half branch unverified. C2 save/load reference gating remains separate.
- New blocker classification: P0 preserve original proven 5V_TEST source and metadata, establish exact active materials and .par custom overrides; P1 check doping/currents/2D AreaFactor and material B/SRH lifetime, NtSide0 region trap status; P2 conditional calibration branch and short smoke/QS/Transient checks; P3 NtSide1e18 at matched J; P4 Half+Coarse vs Full/mesh and no-project modification without explicit approval. Issue #7 append only.

## 2026-10-09 — 5V_TEST confirmed region-specific Mg and NtSide=0 trap excerpts

이택규 directly inspected the active completed 5V_TEST `pp2_des.cmd` (lines 112–175): `Clean_pGaN` and `DmgL_pGaN` explicitly enable `IncompleteIonization(Dopants="pMagnesiumActiveConcentration")`; `DmgL_pGaN` and `DmgL_EBL` trap entries are `Acceptor Conc=0, EnergyMid=0.75 eV from valence, e/h cross-section=1e-15 cm²`. This verifies local Mg ionization *model declarations* and two explicit trap-OFF regions, NOT actual Mg free-carrier/donor doping profile. All other trap region concentrations require complete deck grep (prior audit indicated 12 zero). Global log 'Without incomplete ionization' cannot override observation of region-specific code without scoping analysis. No files altered, 5V results preserved. NEXT READ-ONLY `grep -nE 'Physics \(Region=|IncompleteIonization|Traps|Conc[[:space:]]*=' /user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/pp2_des.cmd`, then SDE doping profile and physics/current density calibration. Publication-grade baseline validation still pending.

## 2026-10-09 — Completed 5V_TEST n2 SDevice preprocessed 12 sidewall traps all OFF (OBSERVED / VERIFIED)

- Worker 이택규 executed directly `grep -nE 'Physics \\(Region=|IncompleteIonization|Traps|Conc[[:space:]]*=' /user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/pp2_des.cmd`, showing physical-region declarations. `Clean_pGaN` `IncompleteIonization` line 128 and `DmgL_pGaN` `IncompleteIonization` line 137.
- Every one of **12 separate preprocessed left damaged-region traps has `Conc=0`**: DmgL_pGaN (line 145), DmgL_EBL (165), DmgL_Barrier0 (185), DmgL_QW1 (205), DmgL_Barrier1 (225), DmgL_QW2 (245), DmgL_Barrier2 (265), DmgL_QW3 (285), DmgL_Barrier3 (305), DmgL_QW4 (325), DmgL_Barrier4 (345), DmgL_nGaN (365). This is **confirmed Trap OFF** for all model's parameterized `DmgL_` sidewall trap regions in completed 5V NtSide=0 deck, not just two example regions. No right-side traps expected in symmetric Half.
- Scientific boundary: global `Recombination(SRH(),Auger(),Radiative)` remains ON and can generate a high baseline SRH without parameterized NtSide traps. Thus measured 5V all-QW SRH fraction 99.886% CANNOT be attributed to any of these explicit sidewall trap concentrations (zero). Cannot conclude sidewall physical damage is absent in reality, or that all other SRH and interface recombination in model is eliminated.
- Mg incomplete ionization `Physics` declarations shown for Clean/DmgL pGaN, but actual Mg donor concentration placement and free-carrier profile are STILL UNVALIDATED. `NtSide=1e18` counterpart also has NOT passed SDevice 5V convergence; no Full/Half+coarse matching, 2D J normalization, material lifetime or transient steady-state acceptance.
- NEXT READ ONLY: inspect preprocessed `pp1_dvs.cmd` from completed `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST` for `sdedr:define-constant-profile`, placements and `pMagnesiumActiveConcentration` / n donors, then verify n1_msh.tdr concentration profiles in SVisual. No new run or changes.

## 2026-10-09 — 5V_TEST SDE p-GaN, EBL and n-GaN doping region placement inspected (OBSERVED / VALUES PENDING)

- Worker 이택규 directly supplied read-only `sed -n '501,615p' /user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/pp1_dvs.cmd`. Actual SDE declarations:
  - `CP_pGaN_Mg`: `pMagnesiumActiveConcentration` assigned variable `N_Mg_p`, placed in `DmgL_pGaN` and `Clean_pGaN`.
  - `CP_EBLp`: `PDopantActiveConcentration` assigned `N_A_EBL`, placed in `DmgL_EBL` and `Clean_EBL`. Explicit code comment calls it an effective active acceptor approximation **deliberately separate from GaN Mg incomplete-ionization calibration**.
  - `CP_EBLx`: `xMoleFraction` assigned `x_Al_EBL`, placed in `DmgL_EBL` and `Clean_EBL`.
  - `CP_nGaN`: `NDopantActiveConcentration` assigned `N_D_n`, placed in `DmgL_nGaN`, `Clean_nGaN`, and `nGaN_base`.
- These observations support correct intended doping **species/region assignment in SDE code**, NOT actual numeric concentrations or actual meshed profiles/free carrier density. The current excerpt does not contain the values of `N_Mg_p`, `N_A_EBL`, `N_D_n`, `x_Al_EBL`, and does not cover QW/Barrier background doping or mole fraction sections below line 615. Cannot declare the entire doping validation gate passed.
- Previous live `pp2_des.cmd` shows `IncompleteIonization` only in `Clean_pGaN` / `DmgL_pGaN`, and all 12 DmgL sidewall traps `Conc=0` in NtSide=0. This now gives a consistent intended separation of GaN Mg and generic effective EBL p-doping, but material-specific activation and numerical ionized density still require validation.
- NEXT read-only: inspect actual parameter constant definitions with `grep -nE 'N_Mg_p|N_A_EBL|N_D_n|x_Al_EBL' /user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/pp1_dvs.cmd | head -n 40`; if numeric definitions split across lines, `sed -n '95,145p' .../pp1_dvs.cmd`. Then inspect SVisual `n1_msh.tdr` Mg/n dopant and EBL Al fraction spatial profiles, compare with specified Kou-based baseline. No edits or rerun.

## 2026-10-09 — Active 5V_TEST SDE numeric doping constants observed (NOT an error conclusion)

- 이택규 ran `grep -nE -C 3 'N_Mg_p|N_A_EBL|N_D_n|x_Al_EBL' .../JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/pp1_dvs.cmd | head -n 100`. Live SDE shows `x_In=0.15` at line 100, `x_Al_EBL=0.15` at line 102, `N_Mg_p=9.59e18 cm^-3` at line 119, `N_A_EBL=3e17` at 121, `N_D_n=5e18` at 123, `N_D_bar=1e15` at 125. Prior lines 501-615 show these variables assigned to intended pGaN, EBL, nGaN/base regions.
- **Critical semantic distinction**: `CMP/COMMON_BASELINE.md` documents `p-GaN effective active acceptor≈3e17 cm^-3`, while SDE assigns **raw `pMagnesiumActiveConcentration`=9.59e18 cm^-3**, with specific GaN `IncompleteIonization` and E0=0.2eV etc in SDevice. This is NOT automatically an error: Mg dopant density ≠ actual ionized Mg acceptor concentration, hole density, or effective active acceptor density. But the intended correspondence to documented 3e17 target is NOT YET CALIBRATED/VERIFIED; do not call 9.59e18 physically valid just from ionization declaration. Very high Mg input may present compensation/solubility concerns needing later literature physical validation.
- `N_A_EBL=3e17, N_D_n=5e18, N_D_bar=1e15, x_In=0.15, x_Al_EBL=0.15` match nominal documented model values (subject to actual SDE material/profile assignment). No code or simulation errors in this grep, no need to rerun now.
- JuSubin TIMELINE earlier records a Half+Coarse `DopingConcentration` SVisual screenshot color scale near -9.59e18 to +5e18, suggestive of signed *input/net dopant profile* representation but no pointwise verified ionized Mg/free-hole density or across-layer cutline. Do not equate `DopingConcentration` with p or ionized Mg.
- NEXT read-only, csh-safe: `sed -n '105,128p' /user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/pp1_dvs.cmd` (inspect inline comments on rationale for 9.59e18); then probe existing n2_des.tdr for `pMagnesiumMinusConcentration`, `hDensity`, `DopingConcentration` in central Clean_pGaN away from contacts and verify 3e17 target only if this is the intended metric. Later calibration/low-current analysis separately. Preserve all sources/data; no new run.

## 2026-10-09 — SDE Mg calibration rationale from actual 5V_TEST comment (OBSERVED COMMENT, NOT MEASURED hDensity)

- 이택규 read `sed -n '105,128p' /user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/pp1_dvs.cmd`. Source comment says: `Mg concentration calibrated previously in this project so that hDensity ~ 3e17 cm^-3 at 300 K with incomplete ionization.` Defined Mg input `N_Mg_p=9.59e18 cm^-3`; EBL effective active acceptor `N_A_EBL=3e17`; n-GaN donor `N_D_n=5e18`; barrier background `N_D_bar=1e15`.
- Distinguish **commented historical calibration intention** from actual reproducible `hDensity`/ionized Mg values: no p-GaN carrier-density probe or calibration condition/equilibrium state was supplied. The comment does NOT prove the current 5 V transient p-GaN `hDensity=3e17`, especially near interfaces/bias. Mg raw input 9.59e18 need NOT be changed to 3e17; do not modify existing .par or do an unnecessary SDE rerun.
- Next action: open preserved `n2_des.tdr` in SVisual, inspect `hDensity` as a 2D field in `Clean_pGaN` at a representative bulk point away from junction/contacts, record coordinates/units/value and bias (5 V). Where available also inspect `pMagnesiumMinusConcentration` (ionized Mg) from same data; check initial 0 V/equilibrium TDR or original calibration artifact before claiming 300 K zero-bias target 3e17 truly reproduced. Do not equate pMagnesiumActiveConcentration or DopingConcentration with free hole density.
- 12/12 NtSide0 sidewall traps verified zero and SDE Mg/EBL/n donor source placements checked earlier. Remaining: effective Mg/holes, donor actual map, 2D J normalization, InGaN SRH calibration and Full/Half comparison. No new run.
